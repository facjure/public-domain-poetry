  ON the street	
Slung on his shoulder is a handle half way across,	
Tied in a big knot on the scoop of cast iron	
Are the overalls faded from sun and rain in the ditches;	
Spatter of dry clay sticking yellow on his left sleeve	        
   And a flimsy shirt open at the throat,	
   I know him for a shovel man,	
   A dago working for a dollar six bits a day	
And a dark-eyed woman in the old country dreams of him for one of the world’s ready men with a pair of fresh lips and a kiss better than all the wild grapes that ever grew in Tuscany.
