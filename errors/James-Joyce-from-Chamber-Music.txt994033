     In the dark pine-wood
     I would we lay,
     In deep cool shadow
     At noon of day.

     How sweet to lie there,
     Sweet to kiss,
     Where the great pine-forest
     Enaisled is!

     Thy kiss descending
     Sweeter were
     With a soft tumult
     Of thy hair.

     O unto the pine-wood
     At noon of day
     Come with me now,
     Sweet love, away.
