Over silent waters
						day descending
										night ascending
floods the gentle glory of the sunset
In a golden greeting
								splendidly to westward
as pale twilight
						trem-
								bles
										into
												Darkness
comes the last light's gracious exhortation
													Lifting up to peace
so when life shall falter
									standing on the shores of the
eternal
god
		May I behold my sunset
Flooding
			over silent waters
