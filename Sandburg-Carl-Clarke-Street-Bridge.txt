 DUST of the feet	
And dust of the wheels,	
Wagons and people going,	
All day feet and wheels.	
 
Now…	        
..Only stars and mist	
A lonely policeman,	
Two cabaret dancers,	
Stars and mist again,	
No more feet or wheels,	        
No more dust and wagons.	
 
   Voices of dollars	
   And drops of blood
    .  .  .  .  .	
   Voices of broken hearts,	
   ..Voices singing, singing,	        
   ..Silver voices, singing,	
   Softer than the stars,	
   Softer than the mist.
