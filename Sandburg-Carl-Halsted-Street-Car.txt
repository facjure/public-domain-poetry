 COME you, cartoonists,	
   Hang on a strap with me here	
   At seven o’clock in the morning	
   On a Halsted street car.	
 
   Take your pencils	        
   And draw these faces.	
 
Try with your pencils for these crooked faces,	
That pig-sticker in one corner—his mouth—	
That overall factory girl—her loose cheeks.	
 
  Find for your pencils	        
  A way to mark your memory	
  Of tired empty faces.	
 
  After their night’s sleep,	
  In the moist dawn	
  And cool daybreak,	        
   Faces	
  Tired of wishes,	
  Empty of dreams
