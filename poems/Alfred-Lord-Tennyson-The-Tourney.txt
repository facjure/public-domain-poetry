Ralph would fight in Edith�s sight,
For Ralph was Edith�s lover,
Ralph went down like a fire to the fight,
Struck to the left and struck to the right,
Roll�d them over and over.
�Gallant Sir Ralph,� said the king.

Casques were crack�d and hauberks hack�d,
Lances snapt in sunder,
Rang the stroke, and sprang the blood,
Knights were thwack�d and riven, and hew�d
Like broad oaks with thunder.
�O what an arm,� said the king.

Edith bow�d her stately head,
Saw them lie confounded,
Edith Montfort bow�d her head,
Crown�d her knight�s, and flush�d as red
As poppies when she crown�d it.
�Take her Sir Ralph,� said the king.
