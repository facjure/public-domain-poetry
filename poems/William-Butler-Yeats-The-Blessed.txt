Cumhal called out, bending his head,
Till Dathi came and stood,
With a blink in his eyes at the cave mouth,
Between the wind and the wood.

And Cumhal said, bending his knees,
�I have come by the windy way
�To gather the half of your blessedness
�And learn to pray when you pray.

�I can bring you salmon out of the streams
�And heron out of the skies.�
But Dathi folded his hands and smiled
With the secrets of God in his eyes.

And Cumhal saw like a drifting smoke
All manner of blessed souls,
Women and children, young men with books,
And old men with croziers and stoles.

�Praise God and God�s mother,� Dathi said,
�For God and God�s mother have sent
�The blessedest souls that walk in the world
�To fill your heart with content.�

�And which is the blessedest,� Cumhal said,
�Where all are comely and good?
�Is it these that with golden thuribles
�Are singing about the wood?�

�My eyes are blinking,� Dathi said,
�With the secrets of God half blind,
�But I can see where the wind goes
�And follow the way of the wind;

�And blessedness goes where the wind goes,
�And when it is gone we are dead;
�I see the blessedest soul in the world
�And he nods a drunken head.

�O blessedness comes in the night and the day
�And whither the wise heart knows;
�And one has seen in the redness of wine
�The Incorruptible Rose,

�That drowsily drops faint leaves on him
�And the sweetness of desire,
�While time and the world are ebbing away
�In twilights of dew and of fire.�
