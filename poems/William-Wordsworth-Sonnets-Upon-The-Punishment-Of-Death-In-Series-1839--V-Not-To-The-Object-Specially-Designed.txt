title: Sonnets Upon The Punishment Of Death - In Series, 1839 � V - Not To The Object Specially Designed
---

 Not to the object specially designed,
 Howe'er momentous in itself it be,
 Good to promote or curb depravity,
 Is the wise Legislator's view confined.
 His Spirit, when most severe, is oft most kind;
 As all Authority in earth depends
 On Love and Fear, their several powers he blends,
 Copying with awe the one Paternal mind.
 Uncaught by processes in show humane,
 He feels how far the act would derogate
 From even the humblest functions of the State;
 If she, self-shorn of Majesty, ordain
 That never more shall hang upon her breath
 The last alternative of Life or Death.
