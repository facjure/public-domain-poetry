Olor Iscanus queries: �Why should we
Vex at the land�s ridiculous miserie?�
So on his Usk banks, in the blood-red dawn
Of England�s civil strife, did careless Vaughan
Bemock his times. O friends of many years!
Though faith and trust are stronger than our fears,
And the signs promise peace with liberty,
Not thus we trifle with our country�s tears
And sweat of agony. The future�s gain
Is certain as God�s truth; but, meanwhile, pain
Is bitter and tears are salt: our voices take
A sober tone; our very household songs
Are heavy with a nation�s griefs and wrongs;
And innocent mirth is chastened for the sake
Of the brave hearts that nevermore shall beat,
The eyes that smile no more, the unreturning feet
