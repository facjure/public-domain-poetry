HEWLETT! as ship to ship
Let us the ensign dip.
There may be who despise
For dross our merchandise,
Our balladries, our bales
Of woven tales;
Yet, Hewlett, the glad gales
Favonian! And what spray
Our dolphins toss'd in play,
Full in old Triton's beard, on Iris' shimmering veils!

Scant tho' the freight of gold
Commercial in our hold,
P�stum, Eridanus
Perchance have barter'd us
 'Bove chrematistic care
