title: Her Only Pilot The Soft Breeze, The Boat
---

 Her only pilot the soft breeze, the boat
 Lingers, but Fancy is well satisfied;
 With keen-eyed Hope, with Memory, at her side,
 And the glad Muse at liberty to note
 All that to each is precious, as we float
 Gently along; regardless who shall chide
 If the heavens smile, and leave us free to glide,
 Happy Associates breathing air remote
 From trivial cares. But, Fancy and the Muse,
 Why have I crowded this small bark with you
 And others of your kind, ideal crew!
 While here sits One whose brightness owes its hues
 To flesh and blood; no Goddess from above,
 No fleeting Spirit, but my own true love?
