title: My Army, O, My Army!
---

My Army, O, my army! The time I dreamed of comes!
I want to see your colours; I want to hear your drums!
I heard them in my boyhood when all men�s hearts seemed cold;
I heard them as a Young Man, and I am growing old!
My army, O, my army! The signs are manifold!

My army, O, my army! My army and my Queen!
I used to sing your battle-songs when I was seventeen!
They came to me from ages, they came from far and near;
They came to me from Paris, they came to me from Here!, 
They came when I was marching with the Army of the Rear.

My Queen�s dark eyes were flashing (oh, she was younger then!);
My Queen�s Red Cap was redder than the reddest blood of men!
My Queen marched like an Amazon, with anger manifest, 
Her dark hair darkly matted from a knifegash in her breast
(For blood will flow where milk will not, her sisters knew the rest).

My legions ne�er were listed, they had no need to be;
My army ne�er was trained in arms, �twas trained in misery!
It took long years to mould it, but war could never drown
The shuffling of my army�s feet in the hunger-haunted town, 
A little child was murdered, and so Tyranny went down.

My army kept no order, my army kept no time;
My army dug no trenches, yet died in dust and slime;
Its troops were fiercely ignorant, as to the manner born;
Its clothes were rags and tatters, or patches worn and torn, 
Ah, me! It wore a uniform that I have often worn!

The faces of my army were ghastly as the dead;
My army�s cause was Hunger, my army�s cry was �Bread!�
It called on God and Mary and Christ of Nazareth;
It cried to kings and courtesans that fainted at its breath, 
Its women beat their poor, flat breasts where babes had starved to death.

My army! My army, I hear the sound of drums
Above the roar of battles, and, lo! my army comes!
Nor creed of man may stay it, nor war, nor nation�s law, 
The pikes go through the firing-lines as pitchforks go through straw, 
Like pitchforks through the litter, while empires stand in awe.
