title: THE Massy Ways, Carried Across These Heights
---

 The massy Ways, carried across these heights
 By Roman perseverance, are destroyed,
 Or hidden under ground, like sleeping worms.
 How venture then to hope that Time will spare
 This humble Walk? Yet on the mountain's side
 A Poet's hand first shaped it; and the steps
 Of that same Bard, repeated to and fro
 At morn, at noon, and under moonlight skies
 Through the vicissitudes of many a year
 Forbade the weeds to creep o'er its grey line.
 No longer, scattering to the heedless winds
 The vocal raptures of fresh poesy,
 Shall he frequent these precincts; locked no more
 In earnest converse with beloved Friends,
 Here will he gather stores of ready bliss,
 As from the beds and borders of a garden
 Choice flowers are gathered! But, if Power may spring
 Out of a farewell yearning, favoured more
 Than kindred wishes mated suitably
 With vain regrets, the Exile would consign
 This Walk, his loved possession, to the care
 Of those pure Minds that reverence the Muse.
