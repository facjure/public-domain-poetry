title: How Great My Grief - (Triolet)
---

How great my grief, my joys how few,
Since first it was my fate to know thee!
- Have the slow years not brought to view
How great my grief, my joys how few,
Nor memory shaped old times anew,
 Nor loving-kindness helped to show thee
How great my grief, my joys how few,
 Since first it was my fate to know thee?
