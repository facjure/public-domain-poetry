 "I have no master," said the Blind Boy,
"My mother, 'Dame Venus' they do call;
 Cowled in this hood she sent me begging
For whate'er in pity may befall.

 "Hard was her visage, me adjuring, - 
'Have no fond mercy on the kind!
 Here be sharp arrows, bunched in quiver,
Draw close ere striking - thou art blind.'

 "So stand I here, my woes entreating,
In this dark alley, lest the Moon
 Point with her sparkling my barbed armoury
Shine on my silver-lac�d shoon.

 "Oh, sir, unkind this Dame to me-ward;
Of the salt billow was her birth ...
 In your sweet charity draw nearer
The saddest rogue on Earth!"
