"Magistratus indicat virum"

 Lonsdale! it were unworthy of a Guest,
 Whose heart with gratitude to thee inclines,
 If he should speak, by fancy touched, of signs
 On thy Abode harmoniously imprest,
 Yet be unmoved with wishes to attest
 How in thy mind and moral frame agree
 Fortitude, and that Christian Charity
 Which, filling, consecrates the human breast.
 And if the Motto on thy 'scutcheon teach
 With truth, "The Magistracy Shows The Man;"
 'That' searching test thy public course has stood;
 As will be owned alike by bad and good,
 Soon as the measuring of life's little span
 Shall place thy virtues out of Envy's reach.
