 Lowther! in thy majestic Pile are seen
 Cathedral pomp and grace, in apt accord
 With the baronial castle's sterner mien;
 Union significant of God adored,
 And charters won and guarded by the sword
 Of ancient honour; whence that goodly state
 Of polity which wise men venerate,
 And will maintain, if God his help afford.
 Hourly the democratic torrent swells;
 For airy promises and hopes suborned
 The strength of backward-looking thoughts is scorned.
 Fall if ye must, ye Towers and Pinnacles,
 With what ye symbolise; authentic Story
 Will say, Ye disappeared with England's Glory!
