There�s not a nook within this solemn Pass,
But were an apt confessional for one
Taught by his summer spent, his autumn gone,
That Life is but a tale of morning grass
Wither�d at eve. From scenes of art which chase
That thought away, turn, and with watchful eyes
Feed it �mid Nature�s old felicities,
Rocks, rivers, and smooth lakes more clear than glass
Untouch�d, unbreathed upon. Thrice happy quest,
If from a golden perch of aspen spray
(October�s workmanship to rival May)
The pensive warbler of the ruddy breast
That moral sweeten by a heaven-taught lay,
Lulling the year, with all its cares, to rest!
