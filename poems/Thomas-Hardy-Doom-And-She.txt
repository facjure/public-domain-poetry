I

 There dwells a mighty pair -
 Slow, statuesque, intense -
 Amid the vague Immense:
None can their chronicle declare,
 Nor why they be, nor whence.

II

 Mother of all things made,
 Matchless in artistry,
 Unlit with sight is she. -
And though her ever well-obeyed
 Vacant of feeling he.

III

 The Matron mildly asks -
 A throb in every word -
 "Our clay-made creatures, lord,
How fare they in their mortal tasks
 Upon Earth's bounded bord?

IV

 "The fate of those I bear,
 Dear lord, pray turn and view,
 And notify me true;
Shapings that eyelessly I dare
 Maybe I would undo.

V

 "Sometimes from lairs of life
 Methinks I catch a groan,
 Or multitudinous moan,
As though I had schemed a world of strife,
 Working by touch alone."

VI

 "World-weaver!" he replies,
 "I scan all thy domain;
 But since nor joy nor pain
Doth my clear substance recognize,
 I read thy realms in vain.

VII

 "World-weaver! what IS Grief?
 And what are Right, and Wrong,
 And Feeling, that belong
To creatures all who owe thee fief?
 What worse is Weak than Strong?" . . .

VIII

 - Unlightened, curious, meek,
 She broods in sad surmise . . .
 - Some say they have heard her sighs
On Alpine height or Polar peak
 When the night tempests rise.
