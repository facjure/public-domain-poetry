 What mischief cleaves to unsubdued regret,
 How fancy sickens by vague hopes beset;
 How baffled projects on the spirit prey,
 And fruitless wishes eat the heart away,
 The Sailor knows; he best, whose lot is cast
 On the relentless sea that holds him fast
 On chance dependent, and the fickle star
 Of power, through long and melancholy war.
 O sad it is, in sight of foreign shores,
 Daily to think on old familiar doors,
 Hearths loved in childhood, and ancestral floors;
 Or, tossed about along a waste of foam,
 To ruminate on that delightful home
 Which with the dear Betrothed 'was' to come;
 Or came and was and is, yet meets the eye
 Never but in the world of memory;
 Or in a dream recalled, whose smoothest range
 Is crossed by knowledge, or by dread, of change,
 And if not so, whose perfect joy makes sleep
 A thing too bright for breathing man to keep.
 Hail to the virtues which that perilous life
 Extracts from Nature's elemental strife;
 And welcome glory won in battles fought
 As bravely as the foe was keenly sought.
 But to each gallant Captain and his crew
 A less imperious sympathy is due,
 Such as my verse now yields, while moonbeams play
 On the mute sea in this unruffled bay;
 Such as will promptly flow from every breast,
 Where good men, disappointed in the quest
 Of wealth and power and honours, long for rest;
 Or, having known the splendours of success,
 Sigh for the obscurities of happiness.
