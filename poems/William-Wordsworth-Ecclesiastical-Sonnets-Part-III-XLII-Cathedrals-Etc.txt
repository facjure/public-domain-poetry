 Open your gates, ye everlasting Piles!
 Types of the spiritual Church which God hath reared;
 Not loth we quit the newly-hallowed sward
 And humble altar, 'mid your sumptuous aisles
 To kneel, or thrid your intricate defiles,
 Or down the nave to pace in motion slow;
 Watching, with upward eye, the tall tower grow
 And mount, at every step, with living wiles
 Instinct to rouse the heart and lead the will
 By a bright ladder to the world above.
 Open your gates, ye Monuments of love
 Divine! thou Lincoln, on thy sovereign hill!
 Thou, stately York! and Ye, whose splendours cheer
 Isis and Cam, to patient Science dear!
