 When twilight darkens, and one by one,
 The sweet birds to their nests have gone;
 When to green banks the glow-worms bring
 Pale lamps to brighten evening;
 Then stirs in his thick sleep the owl
 Through the dewy air to prowl.

 Hawking the meadows swiftly he flits,
 While the small mouse atrembling sits
 With tiny eye of fear upcast
 Until his brooding shape be past,
 Hiding her where the moonbeams beat,
 Casting black shadows in the wheat.

 Now all is still: the field-man is
 Lapped deep in slumbering silentness.
 Not a leaf stirs, but clouds on high
 Pass in dim flocks across the sky,
 Puffed by a breeze too light to move
 Aught but these wakeful sheep above.

 O what an arch of light now spans
 These fields by night no longer Man's!
 Their ancient Master is abroad,
 Walking beneath the moonlight cold:
 His presence is the stillness, He
 Fills earth with wonder and mystery.
