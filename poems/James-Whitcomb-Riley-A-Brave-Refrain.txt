title: A Brave Refrain
---

When snow is here, and the trees look weird,
 And the knuckled twigs are gloved with frost;
When the breath congeals in the drover's beard,
 And the old pathway to the barn is lost;
When the rooster's crow is sad to hear,
 And the stamp of the stabled horse is vain,
And the tone of the cow-bell grieves the ear -
 O then is the time for a brave refrain!

When the gears hang stiff on the harness-peg,
 And the tallow gleams in frozen streaks;
And the old hen stands on a lonesome leg,
 And the pump sounds hoarse and the handle squeaks;
When the woodpile lies in a shrouded heap,
 And the frost is scratched from the window-pane
And anxious eyes from the inside peep -
 O then is the time for a brave refrain!

When the ax-helve warms at the chimney-jamb,
 And hob-nailed shoes on the hearth below,
And the house-cat curls in a slumber calm,
 And the eight-day clock ticks loud and slow;
When the harsh broom-handle jabs the ceil
 'Neath the kitchen-loft, and the drowsy brain
Sniffs the breath of the morning meal -
 O then is the time for a brave refrain!


ENVOI

When the skillet seethes, and a blubbering hot
Tilts the lid of the coffee-pot,
And the scent of the buckwheat cake grows plain -
O then is the time for a brave refrain!
