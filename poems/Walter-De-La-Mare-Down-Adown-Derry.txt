 Down-adown-derry,
Sweet Annie Maroon,
 Gathering daisies
In the meadows of Doone,
 Hears a shrill piping,
Elflike and free,
 Where the waters go brawling
In rills to the sea;
 Singing down-adown-derry.

 Down-adown-derry,
Sweet Annie Maroon,
 Through the green grasses
Peeps softly; and soon
 Spies under green willows
A fairy whose song
 Like the smallest of bubbles
Floats bobbing along;
 Singing down-adown-derry.



 Down-adown-derry,
Her cheeks were like wine,
 Her eyes in her wee face
Like water-sparks shine,
 Her niminy fingers
Her sleek tresses preen,
 The which in the combing
She peeps out between;
 Singing down-adown-derry.

 Down-adown-derry,
Shrill, shrill was her tune: - 
 "Come to my water-house,
Annie Maroon:
 Come in your dimity,
Ribbon on head,
 To wear siller seaweed
And coral instead";
 Singing down-adown-derry.

 "Down-adown-derry,
Lean fish of the sea,
 Bring lanthorns for feasting
The gay Fa�rie;
 'Tis sand for the dancing,
A music all sweet
 In the water-green gloaming
For thistledown feet";
 Singing down-adown-derry.

 Down-adown-derry,
Sweet Annie Maroon
 Looked large on the fairy
Curled wan as the moon
 And all the grey ripples
To the Mill racing by,
 With harps and with timbrels
Did ringing reply;
 Singing down-adown-derry.

 "Down-adown-derry,"
Sang the Fairy of Doone,
 Piercing the heart
Of Sweet Annie Maroon;
 And lo! when like roses
The clouds of the sun
 Faded at dusk, gone
Was Annie Maroon;
 Singing down-adown-derry.

 Down-adown-derry,
The daisies are few;
 Frost twinkles powdery
In haunts of the dew;
 And only the robin
Perched on a thorn,
 Can comfort the heart
Of a father forlorn;
 Singing down-adown-derry.

 Down-adown-derry,
There's snow in the air;
 Ice where the lily
Bloomed waxen and fair;
 He may call o'er the water,
Cry - cry through the Mill,
 But Annie Maroon, alas!
Answer ne'er will;
 Singing down-adown-derry.
