title: To The Lady Mary Lowther

 Lady! I rifled a Parnassian Cave
 (But seldom trod) of mildly-gleaming ore;
 And culled, from sundry beds, a lucid store
 Of genuine crystals, pure as those that pave
 The azure brooks, where Dian joys to lave
 Her spotless limbs; and ventured to explore
 Dim shades for reliques, upon Lethe's shore,
 Cast up at random by the sullen wave.
 To female hands the treasures were resigned;
 And lo this Work! a grotto bright and clear
 From stain or taint; in which thy blameless mind
 May feed on thoughts though pensive not austere;
 Or, if thy deeper spirit be inclined
 To holy musing, it may enter her.
