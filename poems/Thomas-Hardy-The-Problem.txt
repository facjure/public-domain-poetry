title: The Problem
---

 Shall we conceal the Case, or tell it -
 We who believe the evidence?
 Here and there the watch-towers knell it
 With a sullen significance,
Heard of the few who hearken intently and carry an eagerly upstrained sense.

 Hearts that are happiest hold not by it;
 Better we let, then, the old view reign;
 Since there is peace in it, why decry it?
 Since there is comfort, why disdain?
Note not the pigment the while that the painting determines humanity's joy and pain!
