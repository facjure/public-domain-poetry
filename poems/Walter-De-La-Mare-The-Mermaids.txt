 Sand, sand; hills of sand;
And the wind where nothing is
 Green and sweet of the land;
No grass, no trees,
No bird, no butterfly,
 But hills, hills of sand,
And a burning sky.

 Sea, sea, mounds of the sea,
Hollow, and dark, and blue,
 Flashing incessantly
The whole sea through;
No flower, no jutting root,
 Only the floor of the sea,
With foam afloat.

 Blow, blow, winding shells;
And the watery fish,
 Deaf to the hidden bells,
In the water splash;
 No streaming gold, no eyes,
Watching along the waves,
 But far-blown shells, faint bells,
From the darkling caves.
