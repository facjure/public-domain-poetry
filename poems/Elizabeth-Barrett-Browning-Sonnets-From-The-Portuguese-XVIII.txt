I never gave a lock of hair away
To a man, Dearest, except this to thee,
Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully
I ring out to the full brown length and say
�Take it.� My day of youth went yesterday;
My hair no longer bounds to my foot�s glee,
Nor plant I it from rose- or myrtle-tree,
As girls do, any more: it only may
Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,
Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside
Through sorrow�s trick. I thought the funeral-shears
Would take this first, but Love is justified,
Take it thou, finding pure, from all those years,
The kiss my mother left here when she died.
