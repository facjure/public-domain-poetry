title: Cave Of Staffa - After The Crowd Had Departed

 Thanks for the lessons of this Spot fit school
 For the presumptuous thoughts that would assign
 Mechanic laws to agency divine;
 And, measuring heaven by earth, would overrule
 Infinite Power. The pillared vestibule,
 Expanding yet precise, the roof embowed,
 Might seem designed to humble man, when proud
 Of his best workmanship by plan and tool.
 Down-bearing with his whole Atlantic weight
 Of tide and tempest on the Structure's base,
 And flashing to that Structure's topmost height,
 Ocean has proved its strength, and of its grace
 In calms is conscious, finding for his freight
 Of softest music some reponsive place.
