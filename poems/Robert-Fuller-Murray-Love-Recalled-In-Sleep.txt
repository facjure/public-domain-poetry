title: Love Recalled In Sleep
---

There was a time when in your face
 There dwelt such power, and in your smile
I know not what of magic grace;
 They held me captive for a while.

Ah, then I listened for your voice!
 Like music every word did fall,
Making the hearts of men rejoice,
 And mine rejoiced the most of all.

At sight of you, my soul took flame.
 But now, alas! the spell is fled.
Is it that you are not the same,
 Or only that my love is dead?

I know not--but last night I dreamed
 That you were walking by my side,
And sweet, as once you were, you seemed,
 And all my heart was glorified.

Your head against my shoulder lay,
 And round your waist my arm was pressed,
And as we walked a well-known way,
 Love was between us both confessed.

But when with dawn I woke from sleep,
 And slow came back the unlovely truth,
I wept, as an old man might weep
 For the lost paradise of youth.
