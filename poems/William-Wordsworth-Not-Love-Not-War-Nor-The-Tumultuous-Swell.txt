title: Not Love, Not War, Nor The Tumultuous Swell
---

 Not Love, not War, nor the tumultuous swell,
 Of civil conflict, nor the wrecks of change,
 Nor Duty struggling with afflictions strange
 Not these 'alone' inspire the tuneful shell;
 But where untroubled peace and concord dwell,
 There also is the Muse not loth to range,
 Watching the twilight smoke of cot or grange,
 Skyward ascending from a woody dell.
 Meek aspirations please her, lone endeavour,
 And sage content, and placid melancholy;
 She loves to gaze upon a crystal river
 Diaphanous because it travels slowly;
 Soft is the music that would charm for ever;
 The flower of sweetest smell is shy and lowly.
