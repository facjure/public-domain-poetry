---

 Said Secrecy to Cowardice and Fraud,
 Falsehood and Treachery, in close council met,
 Deep under ground, in Pluto's cabinet,
 "The frost of England's pride will soon be thawed;
 "Hooded the open brow that overawed
 "Our schemes; the faith and honour, never yet
 "By us with hope encountered, be upset;
 "For once I burst my bands, and cry, applaud!"
 Then whispered she, "The Bill is carrying out!"
 They heard, and, starting up, the Brood of Night
 Clapped hands, and shook with glee their matted locks;
 All Powers and Places that abhor the light
 Joined in the transport, echoed back their shout,
 Hurrah for, hugging his Ballot-box!
