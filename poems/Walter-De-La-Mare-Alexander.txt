 It was the Great Alexander,
Capped with a golden helm,
 Sate in the ages, in his floating ship,
 In a dead calm.

 Voices of sea-maids singing
Wandered across the deep:
 The sailors labouring on their oars
 Rowed, as in sleep.

 All the high pomp of Asia,
Charmed by that siren lay,
 Out of their weary and dreaming minds,
 Faded away.

 Like a bold boy sate their Captain,
His glamour withered and gone,
 In the souls of his brooding mariners,
 While the song pined on.

 Time, like a falling dew,
Life, like the scene of a dream,
 Laid between slumber and slumber,
 Only did seem....

 O Alexander, then,
In all us mortals too,
 Wax thou not bold - too bold
 On the wave dark-blue!

 Come the calm, infinite night,
Who then will hear
 Aught save the singing
 Of the sea-maids clear?
