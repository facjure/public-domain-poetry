title: Inscriptions For The Spot Where The Hermitage Stood On St. Herbert's Island, Derwentwater.

 If thou in the dear love of some one Friend
 Hast been so happy that thou know'st what thoughts
 Will sometimes in the happiness of love
 Make the heart sink, then wilt thou reverence
 This quiet spot; and, Stranger! not unmoved
 Wilt thou behold this shapeless heap of stones,
 The desolate ruins of St. Herbert's Cell.
 Here stood his threshold; here was spread the roof
 That sheltered him, a self-secluded Man,
 After long exercise in social cares
 And offices humane, intent to adore
 The Deity, with undistracted mind,
 And meditate on everlasting things,
 In utter solitude. But he had left
 A Fellow-labourer, whom the good Man loved
 As his own soul. And, when with eye upraised
 To heaven he knelt before the crucifix,
 While o'er the lake the cataract of Lodore
 Pealed to his orisons, and when he paced
 Along the beach of this small isle and thought
 Of his Companion, he would pray that both
 (Now that their earthly duties were fulfilled)
 Might die in the same moment. Nor in vain
 So prayed he: as our chronicles report,
 Though here the Hermit numbered his last day
 Far from St. Cuthbert his beloved Friend,
 Those holy Men both died in the same hour.
