Ah, that Time could touch a form
That could show what Homer�s age
Bred to be a hero�s wage.
�Were not all her life but storm,
Would not painters paint a form
Of such noble lines� I said,
�Such a delicate high head,
All that sternness amid charm,
All that sweetness amid strength?�
Ah, but peace that comes at length,
Came when Time had touched her form.
