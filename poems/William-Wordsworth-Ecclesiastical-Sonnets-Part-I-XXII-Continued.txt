 Methinks that to some vacant hermitage
 'My' feet would rather turn to some dry nook
 Scooped out of living rock, and near a brook
 Hurled down a mountain-cove from stage to stage,
 Yet tempering, for my sight, its bustling rage
 In the soft heaven of a translucent pool;
 Thence creeping under sylvan arches cool,
 Fit haunt of shapes whose glorious equipage
 Would elevate my dreams. A beechen bowl,
 A maple dish, my furniture should be;
 Crisp, yellow leaves my bed; the hooting owl
 My night-watch: nor should e'er the crested fowl
 From thorp or vill his matins sound for me,
 Tired of the world and all its industry.
