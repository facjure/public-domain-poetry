My Spectre around me night and day
Like a wild beast guards my way;
My Emanation far within
Weeps incessantly for my sin.

�A fathomless and boundless deep,
There we wander, there we weep;
On the hungry craving wind
My Spectre follows thee behind.

�He scents thy footsteps in the snow
Wheresoever thou dost go,
Thro� the wintry hail and rain.
When wilt thou return again?

�Dost thou not in pride and scorn
Fill with tempests all my morn,
And with jealousies and fears
Fill my pleasant nights with tears?

�Seven of my sweet loves thy knife
Has bereav�d of their life.
Their marble tombs I built with tears,
And with cold and shuddering fears.

�Seven more loves weep night and day
Round the tombs where my loves lay,
And seven more loves attend each night
Around my couch with torches bright.

�And seven more loves in my bed
Crown with wine my mournful head,
Pitying and forgiving all
Thy transgressions great and small.

�When wilt thou return and view
My loves, and them to life renew?
When wilt thou return and live?
When wilt thou pity as I forgive?�

�O�er my sins thou sit and moan:
Hast thou no sins of thy own?
O�er my sins thou sit and weep,
And lull thy own sins fast asleep.

�What transgressions I commit
Are for thy transgressions fit.
They thy harlots, thou their slave;
And my bed becomes their grave.

�Never, never, I return:
Still for victory I burn.
Living, thee alone I�ll have;
And when dead I�ll be thy grave.

�Thro� the Heaven and Earth and Hell
Thou shalt never, quell:
I will fly and thou pursue:
Night and morn the flight renew.�

�Poor, pale, pitiable form
That I follow in a storm;
Iron tears and groans of lead
Bind around my aching head.

�Till I turn from Female love
And root up the Infernal Grove,
I shall never worthy be
To step into Eternity.

�And, to end thy cruel mocks,
Annihilate thee on the rocks,
And another form create
To be subservient to my fate.

�Let us agree to give up love,
And root up the Infernal Grove;
Then shall we return and see
The worlds of happy Eternity.

�And throughout all Eternity
I forgive you, you forgive me.
As our dear Redeemer said:
�This the Wine, and this the Bread.��
