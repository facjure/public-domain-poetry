title: The Dog And Cat.
---

 A dog and cat, messmates for life,
 Were often falling into strife,
 Which came to scratching, growls, and snaps,
 And spitting in the face, perhaps.
 A neighbour dog once chanced to call
 Just at the outset of their brawl,
 And, thinking Tray was cross and cruel,
 To snarl so sharp at Mrs. Mew-well,
 Growl'd rather roughly in his ear.
 'And who are you to interfere?'
 Exclaim'd the cat, while in his face she flew;
 And, as was wise, he suddenly withdrew.

 It seems, in spite of all his snarling,
 And hers, that Tray was still her darling.
