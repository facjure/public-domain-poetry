title: Inscription For A Monument In Crosthwaite Church, In The Vale Of Keswick
---

 Ye vales and hills whose beauty hither drew
 The poet's steps, and fixed him here, on you
 His eyes have closed! And ye, loved books, no more
 Shall Southey feed upon your precious lore,
 To works that ne'er shall forfeit their renown,
 Adding immortal labours of his own,
 Whether he traced historic truth, with zeal
 For the State's guidance, or the Church's weal,
 Or Fancy, disciplined by studious art,
 Informed his pen, or wisdom of the heart,
 Or judgments sanctioned in the Patriot's mind
 By reverence for the rights of all mankind.
 Wide were his aims, yet in no human breast
 Could private feelings meet for holier rest.
 His joys, his griefs, have vanished like a cloud
 From Skiddaw's top; but he to heaven was vowed
 Through his industrious life, and Christian faith
 Calmed in his soul the fear of change and death.
