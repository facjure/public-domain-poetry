title: To The River Greta, Near Keswick

 Greta, what fearful listening! when huge stones
 Rumble along thy bed, block after block:
 Or, whirling with reiterated shock,
 Combat, while darkness aggravates the groans:
 But if thou (like Cocytus from the moans
 Heard on his rueful margin) thence wert named
 The Mourner, thy true nature was defamed,
 And the habitual murmur that atones
 For thy worst rage, forgotten. Oft as Spring
 Decks, on thy sinuous banks, her thousand thrones
 Seats of glad instinct and love's caroling,
 The concert, for the happy, then may vie
 With liveliest peals of birth-day harmony:
 To a grieved heart, the notes are benisons.
