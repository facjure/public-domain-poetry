Golden dream of summer morn,
 By a well-remembered stream
In the land where I was born,
Golden dream!

Ripples, by the glancing beam
 Lightly kissed in playful scorn,
Meadows moist with sunlit steam.

When I lift my eyelids worn
 Like a fair mirage you seem,
In the winter dawn forlorn,
Golden dream!
