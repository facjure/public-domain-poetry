title: Noon And Night Flower
---

Not any flower that blows
But shining watch doth keep;
 Every swift changing chequered hour it knows
 Now to break forth in beauty; now to sleep.

This for the roving bee
Keeps open house, and this
 Stainless and clear is, that in darkness she
 May lure the moth to where her nectar is.

Lovely beyond the rest
Are these of all delight: - 
 The tiny pimpernel that noon loves best,
 The primrose palely burning through the night.

One 'neath day's burning sky
With ruby decks her place,
 The other when Eve's chariot glideth by
 Lifts her dim torch to light that dreaming face.
