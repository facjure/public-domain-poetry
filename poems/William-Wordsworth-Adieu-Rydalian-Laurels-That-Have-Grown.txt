title:  Adieu, Rydalian Laurels! That Have Grown

 Adieu, Rydalian Laurels! that have grown
 And spread as if ye knew that days might come
 When ye would shelter in a happy home,
 On this fair Mount, a Poet of your own,
 One who ne'er ventured for a Delphic crown
 To sue the God; but, haunting your green shade
 All seasons through, is humbly pleased to braid
 Ground-flowers, beneath your guardianship, self-sown.
 Farewell! no Minstrels now with harp new-strung
 For summer wandering quit their household bowers;
 Yet not for this wants Poesy a tongue
 To cheer the Itinerant on whom she pours
 Her spirit, while he crosses lonely moors,
 Or musing sits forsaken halls among.
