 Yet many a Novice of the cloistral shade,
 And many chained by vows, with eager glee
 The warrant hail, exulting to be free;
 Like ships before whose keels, full long embayed
 In polar ice, propitious winds have made
 Unlooked-for outlet to an open sea,
 Their liquid world, for bold discovery,
 In all her quarters temptingly displayed!
 Hope guides the young; but when the old must pass
 The threshold, whither shall they turn to find
 The hospitality, the alms (alas!
 Alms may be needed) which that House bestowed?
 Can they, in faith and worship, train the mind
 To keep this new and questionable road?
