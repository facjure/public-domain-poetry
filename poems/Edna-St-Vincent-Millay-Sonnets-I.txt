 We talk of taxes, and I call you friend;
 Well, such you are,--but well enough we know
 How thick about us root, how rankly grow
 Those subtle weeds no man has need to tend,
 That flourish through neglect, and soon must send
 Perfume too sweet upon us and overthrow
 Our steady senses; how such matters go
 We are aware, and how such matters end.
 Yet shall be told no meagre passion here;
 With lovers such as we forevermore
 Isolde drinks the draught, and Guinevere
 Receives the Table's ruin through her door,
 Francesca, with the loud surf at her ear,
 Lets fall the colored book upon the floor.
