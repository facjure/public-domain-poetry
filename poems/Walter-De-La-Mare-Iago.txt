 A dark lean face, a narrow, slanting eye,
 Whose deeps of blackness one pale taper's beam
 Haunts with a fitting madness of desire;
 A heart whose cinder at the breath of passion
 Glows to a momentary core of heat
 Almost beyond indifference to endure:
 So parched Iago frets his life away.
 His scorn works ever in a brain whose wit
 This world hath fools too many and gross to seek.
 Ever to live incredibly alone,
 Masked, shivering, deadly, with a simple Moor
 Of idiot gravity, and one pale flower
 Whose chill would quench in everlasting peace
 His soul's unmeasured flame - O paradox!
 Might he but learn the trick! - to wear her heart
 One fragile hour of heedless innocence,
 And then, farewell, and the incessant grave.
 "O fool! O villain!" - 'tis the shuttlecock
 Wit never leaves at rest. It is his fate
 To be a needle in a world of hay,
 Where honour is the flattery of the fool;
 Sin, a tame bauble; lies, a tiresome jest;
 Virtue, a silly, whitewashed block of wood
 For words to fell. Ah! but the secret lacking,
 The secret of the child, the bird, the night,
 Faded, flouted, bespattered, in days so far
 Hate cannot bitter them, nor wrath deny;
 Else were this Desdemona.... Why!
 Woman a harlot is, and life a nest
 Fouled by long ages of forked fools. And God - 
 Iago deals not with a tale so dull:
 To have made the world! Fie on thee, Artisan!
