title: The Armenian Lady's Love
---

 I

 You have heard "a Spanish Lady
 How she wooed an English man;"
 Hear now of a fair Armenian,
 Daughter of the proud Soldan;
 How she loved a Christian slave, and told her pain
 By word, look, deed, with hope that he might love again.

 II

 "Pluck that rose, it moves my liking,"
 Said she, lifting up her veil;
 "Pluck it for me, gentle gardener,
 Ere it wither and grow pale."
 "Princess fair, I till the ground, but may not take
 From twig or bed an humbler flower, even for your sake!"

 III

 "Grieved am I, submissive Christian!
 To behold thy captive state;
 Women, in your land, may pity
 (May they not?) the unfortunate."
 "Yes, kind Lady! otherwise man could not bear
 Life, which to every one that breathes is full of care."

 IV

 "Worse than idle is compassion
 If it end in tears and sighs;
 Thee from bondage would I rescue
 And from vile indignities;
 Nurtured, as thy mien bespeaks, in high degree,
 Look up, and help a hand that longs to set thee free."

 V

 "Lady! dread the wish, nor venture
 In such peril to engage;
 Think how it would stir against you
 Your most loving father's rage:
 Sad deliverance would it be, and yoked with shame,
 Should troubles overflow on her from whom it came."

 VI

 "Generous Frank! the just in effort
 Are of inward peace secure:
 Hardships for the brave encountered,
 Even the feeblest may endure:
 If almighty grace through me thy chains unbind
 My father for slave's work may seek a slave in mind."

 VII

 "Princess, at this burst of goodness,
 My long-frozen heart grows warm!"
 "Yet you make all courage fruitless,
 Me to save from chance of harm:
 Leading such companion I that gilded dome,
 Yon minarets, would gladly leave for his worst home."

 VIII

 "Feeling tunes your voice, fair Princess,
 And your brow is free from scorn,
 Else these words would come like mockery,
 Sharper than the pointed thorn."
 "Whence the undeserved mistrust? Too wide apart
 Our faith hath been, O would that eyes could see the heart!"

 IX

 "Tempt me not, I pray; my doom is
 These base implements to wield;
 Rusty lance, I ne'er shall grasp thee,
 Ne'er assoil my cobwebbed shield!
 Never see my native land, nor castle towers,
 Nor Her who thinking of me there counts widowed hours."

 X

 "Prisoner! pardon youthful fancies;
 Wedded? If you 'can', say no!
 Blessed is and be your consort;
 Hopes I cherished, let them go!
 Handmaid's privilege would leave my purpose free,
 Without another link to my felicity."

 XI

 "Wedded love with loyal Christians,
 Lady, is a mystery rare;
 Body, heart, and soul in union,
 Make one being of a pair."
 "Humble love in me would look for no return,
 Soft as a guiding star that cheers, but cannot burn."

 XII

 "Gracious Allah! by such title
 Do I dare to thank the God,
 Him who thus exalts thy spirit,
 Flower of an unchristian sod!
 Or hast thou put off wings which thou in heaven dost wear?
 What have I seen, and heard, or dreamt? where am I? where?"

 XIII

 Here broke off the dangerous converse:
 Less impassioned words might tell
 How the pair escaped together,
 Tears not wanting, nor a knell
 Of sorrow in her heart while through her father's door,
 And from her narrow world, she passed for evermore.

 XIV

 But affections higher, holier,
 Urged her steps; she shrunk from trust
 In a sensual creed that trampled
 Woman's birthright into dust.
 Little be the wonder then, the blame be none,
 If she, a timid Maid, hath put such boldness on.

 XV

 Judge both Fugitives with knowledge:
 In those old romantic days
 Mighty were the soul's commandments
 To support, restrain, or raise.
 Foes might hang upon their path, snakes rustle near,
 But nothing from their inward selves had they to fear.

 XVI

 Thought infirm ne'er came between them,
 Whether printing desert sands
 With accordant steps, or gathering
 Forest-fruit with social hands;
 Or whispering like two reeds that in the cold moonbeam
 Bend with the breeze their heads, beside a crystal stream.

 XVII

 On a friendly deck reposing
 They at length for Venice steer;
 There, when they had closed their voyage
 One, who daily on the pier
 Watched for tidings from the East, beheld his Lord,
 Fell down and clasped his knees for joy, not uttering word.

 XVIII

 Mutual was the sudden transport;
 Breathless questions followed fast,
 Years contracting to a moment,
 Each word greedier than the last:
 "Hie thee to the Countess, friend! return with speed,
 And of this Stranger speak by whom her lord was freed.

 XIX

 Say that I, who might have languished,
 Drooped and pined till life was spent,
 Now before the gates of Stolberg
 My Deliverer would present
 For a crowning recompense, the precious grace
 Of her who in my heart still holds her ancient place.

 XX

 Make it known that my Companion
 Is of royal eastern blood,
 Thirsting after all perfection,
 Innocent, and meek, and good,
 Though with misbelievers bred; but that dark night
 Will holy Church disperse by means of gospel-light."

 XXI

 Swiftly went that grey-haired Servant,
 Soon returned a trusty Page
 Charged with greetings, benedictions,
 Thanks and praises, each a gage
 For a sunny thought to cheer the Stranger's way,
 Her virtuous scruples to remove, her fears allay.

 XXII

 And how blest the Reunited,
 While beneath their castle-walls,
 Runs a deafening noise of welcome! 
 Blest, though every tear that falls
 Doth in its silence of past sorrow tell,
 And makes a meeting seem most like a dear farewell.

 XXIII

 Through a haze of human nature,
 Glorified by heavenly light,
 Looked the beautiful Deliverer
 On that overpowering sight,
 While across her virgin cheek pure blushes strayed,
 For every tender sacrifice her heart had made.

 XXIV

 On the ground the weeping Countess
 Knelt, and kissed the Stranger's hand;
 Act of soul-devoted homage,
 Pledge of an eternal band:
 Nor did aught of future days that kiss belie,
 Which, with a generous shout, the crowd did ratify.

 XXV

 Constant to the fair Armenian,
 Gentle pleasures round her moved,
 Like a tutelary spirit
 Reverenced, like a sister, loved,
 Christian meekness smoothed for all the path of life,
 Who, loving most, should wiseliest love, their only strife.

 XXVI

 Mute memento of that union
 In a Saxon church survives,
 Where a cross-legged Knight lies sculptured
 As between two wedded wives 
 Figures with armorial signs of race and birth,
 And the vain rank the pilgrims bore while yet on earth.
