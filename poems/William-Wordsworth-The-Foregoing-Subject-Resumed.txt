 Among a grave fraternity of Monks,
 For One, but surely not for One alone,
 Triumphs, in that great work, the Painter's skill,
 Humbling the body, to exalt the soul;
 Yet representing, amid wreck and wrong
 And dissolution and decay, the warm
 And breathing life of flesh, as if already
 Clothed with impassive majesty, and graced
 With no mean earnest of a heritage
 Assigned to it in future worlds. Thou, too,
 With thy memorial flower, meek Portraiture!
 From whose serene companionship I passed
 Pursued by thoughts that haunt me still; thou also
 Though but a simple object, into light
 Called forth by those affections that endear
 The private hearth; though keeping thy sole seat
 In singleness, and little tried by time,
 Creation, as it were, of yesterday
 With a congenial function art endued
 For each and all of us, together joined
 In course of nature under a low roof
 By charities and duties that proceed
 Out of the bosom of a wiser vow.
 To a like salutary sense of awe
 Or sacred wonder, growing with the power
 Of meditation that attempts to weigh,
 In faithful scales, things and their opposites,
 Can thy enduring quiet gently raise
 A household small and sensitive, whose love,
 Dependent as in part its blessings are
 Upon frail ties dissolving or dissolved
 On earth, will be revived, we trust, in heaven.
