title: The Black Stones Of Iona
---

 Here on their knees men swore: the stones were black,
 Black in the people's minds and words, yet they
 Were at that time, as now, in colour grey.
 But what is colour, if upon the rack
 Of conscience souls are placed by deeds that lack
 Concord with oaths? What differ night and day
 Then, when before the Perjured on his way
 Hell opens, and the heavens in vengeance crack
 Above his head uplifted in vain prayer
 To Saint, or Fiend, or to the Godhead whom
 He had insulted Peasant, King, or Thane?
 Fly where the culprit may, guilt meets a doom;
 And, from invisible worlds at need laid bare,
 Come links for social order's awful chain.
