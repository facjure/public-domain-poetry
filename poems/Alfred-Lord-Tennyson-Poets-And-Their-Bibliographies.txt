title: Poets And Their Bibliographies

Old poets foster�d under friendlier skies,
Old Virgil who would write ten lines, they say,
At dawn, and lavish all the golden day
To make them wealthier in his readers� eyes;
And you, old popular Horace, you the wise
Adviser of the nine-years-ponder'd lay,
And you, that wear a wreath of sweeter bay,
Catullus, whose dead songster never dies;
If, glancing downward on the kindly sphere
That once had roll�d you round and round the sun,
You see your Art still shrined in human shelves,
You should be jubilant that you flourish�d here
Before the Love of Letters, overdone,
Had swampt the sacred poets with themselves.
