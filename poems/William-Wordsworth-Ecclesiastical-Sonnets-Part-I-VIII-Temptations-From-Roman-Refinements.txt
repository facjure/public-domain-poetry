 Watch, and be firm! for, soul-subduing vice,
 Heart-killing luxury, on your steps await.
 Fair houses, baths, and banquets delicate,
 And temples flashing, bright as polar ice,
 Their radiance through the woods, may yet suffice
 To sap your hardy virtue, and abate
 Your love of Him upon whose forehead sate
 The crown of thorns; whose life-blood flowed, the price
 Of your redemption. Shun the insidious arts
 That Rome provides, less dreading from her frown
 Than from her wily praise, her peaceful gown,
 Language, and letters; these, though fondly viewed
 As humanising graces, are but parts
 And instruments of deadliest servitude!
