title: At Bala-Sala, Isle Of Man

 Broken in fortune, but in mind entire
 And sound in principle, I seek repose
 Where ancient trees this convent-pile enclose,
 In ruin beautiful. When vain desire
 Intrudes on peace, I pray the eternal Sire
 To cast a soul-subduing shade on me,
 A grey-haired, pensive, thankful Refugee;
 A shade, but with some sparks of heavenly fire
 Once to these cells vouchsafed. And when I note
 The old Tower's brow yellowed as with the beams
 Of sunset ever there, albeit streams
 Of stormy weather-stains that semblance wrought,
 I thank the silent Monitor, and say
 "Shine so, my aged brow, at all hours of the day!"
