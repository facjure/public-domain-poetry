 These wet rocks where the tide has been,
 Barnacled white and weeded brown
 And slimed beneath to a beautiful green,
 These wet rocks where the tide went down
 Will show again when the tide is high
 Faint and perilous, far from shore,
 No place to dream, but a place to die,--
 The bottom of the sea once more.
 There was a child that wandered through
 A giant's empty house all day,--
 House full of wonderful things and new,
 But no fit place for a child to play.
