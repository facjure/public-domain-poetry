title: Refuge
---

From my spirit�s gray defeat,
From my pulse�s flagging beat,
From my hopes that turned to sand
Sifting through my close-clenched hand,
From my own fault�s slavery,
If I can sing, I still am free.

For with my singing I can make
A refuge for my spirit�s sake,
A house of shining words, to be
My fragile immortality.
