---

 The Kirk of Ulpha to the pilgrim's eye
 Is welcome as a star, that doth present
 Its shining forehead through the peaceful rent
 Of a black cloud diffused o'er half the sky:
 Or as a fruitful palm-tree towering high
 O'er the parched waste beside an Arab's tent;
 Or the Indian tree whose branches, downward bent,
 Take root again, a boundless canopy.
 How sweet were leisure! could it yield no more
 Than 'mid that wave-washed Churchyard to recline,
 From pastoral graves extracting thoughts divine;
 Or there to pace, and mark the summits hoar
 Of distant moonlit mountains faintly shine,
 Soothed by the unseen River's gentle roar.
