 I knocked upon thy door ajar,
 While yet the woods with buds were grey;
 Nought but a little child I heard
 Warbling at break of day.

 I knocked when June had lured her rose
 To mask the sharpness of its thorn;
 Knocked yet again, heard only yet
 Thee singing of the morn.

 The frail convolvulus had wreathed
 Its cup, but the faint flush of eve
 Lingered upon thy Western wall;
 Thou hadst no word to give.

 Once yet I came; the winter stars
 Above thy house wheeled wildly bright;
 Footsore I stood before thy door - 
 Wide open into night.
