 When Queen Djenira slumbers through
The sultry noon's repose,
 From out her dreams, as soft she lies,
A faint thin music flows.

 Her lovely hands lie narrow and pale
With gilded nails, her head
 Couched in its banded nets of gold
Lies pillowed on her bed.

 The little Nubian boys who fan
Her cheeks and tresses clear,
 Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful voices
Seem afar to hear.

 They slide their eyes, and nodding, say,
"Queen Djenira walks to-day
 The courts of the lord Pthamasar
Where the sweet birds of Psuthys are."

 And those of earth about her porch
Of shadow cool and grey
 Their sidelong beaks in silence lean,
And silent flit away.
