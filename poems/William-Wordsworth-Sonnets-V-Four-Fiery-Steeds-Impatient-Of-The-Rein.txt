title: Sonnets - V. - Four Fiery Steeds Impatient Of The Rein
---

 Four fiery steeds impatient of the rein
 Whirled us o'er sunless ground beneath a sky
 As void of sunshine, when, from that wide plain,
 Clear tops of far-off mountains we descry,
 Like a Sierra of cerulean Spain,
 All light and lustre. Did no heart reply;
 Yes, there was One; for One, asunder fly
 The thousand links of that ethereal chain;
 And green vales open out, with grove and field,
 And the fair front of many a happy Home;
 Such tempting spots as into vision come
 While Soldiers, weary of the arms they wield
 And sick at heart of strifeful Christendom,
 Gaze on the moon by parting clouds revealed.
