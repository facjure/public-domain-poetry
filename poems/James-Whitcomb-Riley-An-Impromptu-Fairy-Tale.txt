 When I wuz ist a little bit
 o' weenty-teenty kid
 I maked up a Fairy-tale,
 all by myse'f, I did: - 



 I

 Wunst upon a time wunst
They wuz a Fairy King,
 An' ever'thing he have wuz gold - ,
His clo'es, an' ever'thing!
 An' all the other Fairies
In his goldun Palace-hall
 Had to hump an' hustle - 
'Cause he wuz bosst of all!



 II

 He have a goldun trumput,
An' when he blow' on that,
 It's a sign he want' his boots,
Er his coat er hat:
 They's a sign fer ever'thing, - 
An' all the Fairies knowed
 Ever' sign, an' come a-hoppin'
When the King blowed!



 III

 Wunst he blowed an' telled 'em all:
"Saddle up yer bees - 
 Fireflies is gittin' fat
An' sassy as you please! - 
 Guess we'll go a-huntin'!"
So they hunt' a little bit,
 Till the King blowed "Supper-time,"
Nen they all quit.



 IV

 Nen they have a Banqut
In the Palace-hall,
 An' ist et! an' et! an' et!
Nen they have a Ball;
 An' when the Queen o' Fairyland
Come p'omenadin' through,
 The King says an' halts her, - 
"Guess I'll marry you!"
