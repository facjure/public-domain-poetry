---

 'Mid crowded obelisks and urns
 I sought the untimely grave of Burns;
 Sons of the Bard, my heart still mourns
 With sorrow true;
 And more would grieve, but that it turns
 Trembling to you!

 Through twilight shades of good and ill
 Ye now are panting up life's hill,
 And more than common strength and skill
 Must ye display;
 If ye would give the better will
 Its lawful sway.

 Hath Nature strung your nerves to bear
 Intemperance with less harm, beware!
 But if the Poet's wit ye share,
 Like him can speed
 The social hour, of tenfold care
 There will be need;

 For honest men delight will take
 To spare your failings for his sake,
 Will flatter you, and fool and rake
 Your steps pursue;
 And of your Father's name will make
 A snare for you.

 Far from their noisy haunts retire,
 And add your voices to the quire
 That sanctify the cottage fire
 With service meet;
 There seek the genius of your Sire,
 His spirit greet;

 Or where, 'mid "lonely heights and hows,"
 He paid to Nature tuneful vows;
 Or wiped his honourable brows
 Bedewed with toil,
 While reapers strove, or busy ploughs
 Upturned the soil;

 His judgment with benignant ray
 Shall guide, his fancy cheer, your way;
 But ne'er to a seductive lay
 Let faith be given;
 Nor deem that "light which leads astray,
 Is light from Heaven."

 Let no mean hope your souls enslave;
 Be independent, generous, brave;
 Your Father such example gave,
 And such revere;
 But be admonished by his grave,
 And think, and fear!
