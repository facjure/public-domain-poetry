title: The Romance Of Patrolman Casey
---

There was a young patrolman who
Had large but tender feet;
They always hurt him badly when
He walked upon his beat.
(He always took them with him when
He walked upon his beat.)

His name was Patrick Casey and
A sweetheart fair had he;
Her face was full of freckles, but
Her name was Kate McGee.
(It was in spite of freckles that
Her name was Kate McGee.)

�Oh, Pat!� she said, �I�ll wed you when
Promotion comes to you!�
�I�m much-obliged,� he answered, and
�I�ll see what I can do.�
(I may remark he said it thus,
�Oi�ll say phwat Oi kin do.�)

So then he bought some new shoes which
Allowed his feet more ease,
They may have been large twelves. Perhaps
Eighteens, or twenty-threes.
(That�s rather large for shoes, I think,
Eighteens or twenty-threes!)

What last they were I don�t know, but
Somehow it seems to me
I�ve heard somewhere they either were
A, B, C, D, or E.
(More likely they were five lasts wide,
A, B plus C, D, E.)

They were the stoutest cowhide that
Could be peeled off a cow.

But he was not promoted

So
Kate wed him anyhow.

(This world is crowded full of Kates
That wed them anyhow.)
