Nevah min', Miss Lucy.

But you could n't hide f'om me.
Ain't I got two eyes to see!
Nevah min', Miss Lucy.

Guess you thought you's awful keen;
Nevah min', Miss Lucy.

Seen him tek yo' ahm jes' so,
When he got outside de do'--

Nevah min', Miss Lucy.

Say now, honey, wha 'd he say?--

Keep yo' secrets--dat's yo' way--

Know huh, too, huh name is Sal;
