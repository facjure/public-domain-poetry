�Tis a yarn I heard of a new-chum �trap�
On the edge of the Never-Never,
Where the dead men lie and the black men lie,
And the bushman lies for ever.
�Twas the custom still with the local blacks
To cadge in the �altogether�
They had less respect for our feelings then,
And more respect for the weather.

The trooper said to the sergeant�s wife:
�Sure, I wouldn�t seem unpleasant;
�But there�s women and childer about the place,
�And barrin� a lady�s present

�There�s ould King Billy wid niver a stitch
�For a month may the drought cremate him!
�Bar the wan we put in his dirty head,
�Where his old Queen Mary bate him.

�God give her strength! and a peaceful reign
�Though she flies in a bit av a passion
�If ony wan hints that her shtoyle an� luks
�Are a trifle behind the fashion.

�There�s two of the boys by the stable now
�Be the powers! I�ll teach the varmints
�To come wid nought but a shirt apiece,
�And wid dirt for their nayther garmints.

�Howld on, ye blaggards! How dare ye dare
�To come widin sight av the houses?
�I�ll give ye a warnin� all for wance
�An� a couple of ould pair of trousers.�

They took the pants as a child a toy,
The constable�s words beguiling
A smile of something beside their joy;
And they took their departure smiling.

And that very day, when the sun was low,
Two blackfellows came to the station;
They were filled with the courage of Queensland rum
And bursting with indignation.

The constable noticed, with growing ire,
They�d apparently dressed in a hurry;
And their language that day, I am sorry to say,
Mostly consisted of �plurry.�

The constable heard, and he wished himself back
In the land of the bogs and the ditches
�You plurry big tight-britches p�liceman, what for
�You gibbit our missuses britches?�

And this was a case, I am bound to confess,
Where civilisation went under;
Had one of the gins been less modest in dress
He�d never have made such a blunder.

And here let the moral be duly made known,
And hereafter signed and attested:
We should place more reliance on that which is shown
And less upon what is suggested.
