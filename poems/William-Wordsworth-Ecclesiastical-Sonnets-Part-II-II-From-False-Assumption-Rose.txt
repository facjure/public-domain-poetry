title: Ecclesiastical Sonnets - Part II. - II - From False Assumption Rose
---

 From false assumption rose, and, fondly hailed
 By superstition, spread the Papal power;
 Yet do not deem the Autocracy prevailed
 Thus only, even in error's darkest hour.
 She daunts, forth-thundering from her spiritual tower,
 Brute rapine, or with gentle lure she tames.
 Justice and Peace through Her uphold their claims;
 And Chastity finds many a sheltering bower.
 Realm there is none that if controlled or swayed
 By her commands partakes not, in degree,
 Of good, o'er manners arts and arms, diffused:
 Yes, to thy domination, Roman See,
 Tho' miserably, oft monstrously, abused
 By blind ambition, be this tribute paid.
