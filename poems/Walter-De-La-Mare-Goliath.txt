 Still as a mountain with dark pines and sun
 He stood between the armies, and his shout
 Rolled from the empyrean above the host:
 "Bid any little flea ye have come forth,
 And wince at death upon my finger-nail!"
 He turned his large-boned face; and all his steel
 Tossed into beams the lustre of the noon;
 And all the shaggy horror of his locks
 Rustled like locusts in a field of corn.
 The meagre pupil of his shameless eye
 Moved like a cormorant over a glassy sea.
 He stretched his limbs, and laughed into the air,
 To feel the groaning sinews of his breast,
 And the long gush of his swollen arteries pause:
 And, nodding, wheeled, towering in all his height.
 Then, like a wind that hushes, gazed and saw
 Down, down, far down upon the untroubled green
 A shepherd-boy that swung a little sling.
 Goliath shut his lids to drive that mote,
 Which vexed the eastern azure of his eye,
 Out of his vision; and stared down again.
 Yet stood the youth there, ruddy in the flare
 Of his vast shield, nor spake, nor quailed, gazed up,
 As one might scan a mountain to be scaled.
 Then, as it were, a voice unearthly still
 Cried in the cavern of his bristling ear,
 "His name is Death!" ... And, like the flush
 That dyes Sahara to its lifeless verge,
 His brows' bright brass flamed into sudden crimson;
 And his great spear leapt upward, lightning-like,
 Shaking a dreadful thunder in the air;
 Spun betwixt earth and sky, bright as a berg
 That hoards the sunlight in a myriad spires,
 Crashed: and struck echo through an army's heart.
 Then paused Goliath, and stared down again.
 And fleet-foot Fear from rolling orbs perceived
 Steadfast, unharmed, a stooping shepherd-boy
 Frowning upon the target of his face.
 And wrath tossed suddenly up once more his hand;
 And a deep groan grieved all his strength in him.
 He breathed; and, lost in dazzling darkness, prayed - 
 Besought his reins, his gloating gods, his youth:
 And turned to smite what he no more could see.
 Then sped the singing pebble-messenger,
 The chosen of the Lord from Israel's brooks,
 Fleet to its mark, and hollowed a light path
 Down to the appalling Babel of his brain.
 And like the smoke of dreaming Souffri�re
 Dust rose in cloud, spread wide, slow silted down
 Softly all softly on his armour's blaze.
