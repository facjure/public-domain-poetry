 Censers are swinging
 Over the town;
 Censers are swinging,
 Look overhead!
 Censers are swinging,
 Heaven comes down.
 City, dead city,
 Awake from the dead!

 Censers, tremendous,
 Gleam overhead.
 Wind-harps are ringing,
 Wind-harps unseen - 
 Calling and calling: - 
 "Wake from the dead.
 Rise, little city,
 Shine like a queen."

 Soldiers of Christ
 For battle grow keen.
 Heaven-sent winds
 Haunt alley and lane.
 Singing of life
 In town-meadows green
 After the toil
 And battle and pain.

 Incense is pouring
 Like the spring rain
 Down on the mob
 That moil through the street.
 Blessed are they
 Who behold it and gain
 Power made more mighty
 Thro' every defeat.

 Builders, toil on.
 Make all complete.
 Make Springfield wonderful.
 Make her renown
 Worthy this day,
 Till, at God's feet,
 Tranced, saved forever,
 Waits the white town.

 Censers are swinging
 Over the town,
 Censers gigantic!
 Look overhead!
 Hear the winds singing: - 
 "Heaven comes down.
 City, dead city,
 Awake from the dead."
