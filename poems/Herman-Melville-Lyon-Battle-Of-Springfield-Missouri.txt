 (August, 1861.)


 Some hearts there are of deeper sort,
 Prophetic, sad,
 Which yet for cause are trebly clad;
 Known death they fly on:
 This wizard-heart and heart-of-oak had Lyon.

 "They are more than twenty thousand strong,
 We less than five,
 Too few with such a host to strive"
 "Such counsel, fie on!
 'Tis battle, or 'tis shame;" and firm stood Lyon.

 "For help at need in van we wait - 
 Retreat or fight:
 Retreat the foe would take for flight,
 And each proud scion
 Feel more elate; the end must come," said Lyon.

 By candlelight he wrote the will,
 And left his all
 To Her for whom 'twas not enough to fall;
 Loud neighed Orion
 Without the tent; drums beat; we marched with Lyon.

 The night-tramp done, we spied the Vale
 With guard-fires lit;
 Day broke, but trooping clouds made gloom of it:
 "A field to die on"
 Presaged in his unfaltering heart, brave Lyon.

 We fought on the grass, we bled in the corn - 
 Fate seemed malign;
 His horse the Leader led along the line - 
 Star-browed Orion;
 Bitterly fearless, he rallied us there, brave Lyon.

 There came a sound like the slitting of air
 By a swift sharp sword - 
 A rush of the sound; and the sleek chest broad
 Of black Orion
 Heaved, and was fixed; the dead mane waved toward Lyon.

 "General, you're hurt - this sleet of balls!"
 He seemed half spent;
 With moody and bloody brow, he lowly bent:
 "The field to die on;
 But not - not yet; the day is long," breathed Lyon.

 For a time becharmed there fell a lull
 In the heart of the fight;
 The tree-tops nod, the slain sleep light;
 Warm noon-winds sigh on,
 And thoughts which he never spake had Lyon.

 Texans and Indians trim for a charge:
 "Stand ready, men!
 Let them come close, right up, and then
 After the lead, the iron;
 Fire, and charge back!" So strength returned to Lyon.

 The Iowa men who held the van,
 Half drilled, were new
 To battle: "Some one lead us, then we'll do"
 Said Corporal Tryon:
 "Men! I will lead," and a light glared in Lyon.

 On they came: they yelped, and fired;
 His spirit sped;
 We leveled right in, and the half-breeds fled,
 Nor stayed the iron,
 Nor captured the crimson corse of Lyon.

 This seer foresaw his soldier-doom,
 Yet willed the fight.
 He never turned; his only flight
 Was up to Zion,
 Where prophets now and armies greet brave Lyon.
