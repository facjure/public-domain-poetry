The world goes up and the world goes down,
 And the sunshine follows the rain;
And yesterday's sneer and yesterday's frown
 Can never come over again,
 Sweet wife:
 No, never come over again.

For woman is warm though man be cold,
 And the night will hallow the day;
Till the heart which at even was weary and old
 Can rise in the morning gay,
 Sweet wife;
 To its work in the morning gay.

Andernach, 1851.
