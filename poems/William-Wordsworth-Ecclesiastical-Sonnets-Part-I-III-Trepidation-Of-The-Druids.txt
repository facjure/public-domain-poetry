 Screams round the Arch-druid's brow the seamew white
 As Menai's foam; and toward the mystic ring
 Where Augurs stand, the Future questioning,
 Slowly the cormorant aims her heavy flight,
 Portending ruin to each baleful rite,
 That, in the lapse of ages, hath crept o'er
 Diluvian truths, and patriarchal lore.
 Haughty the Bard: can these meek doctrines blight
 His transports? wither his heroic strains?
 But all shall be fulfilled; the Julian spear
 A way first opened; and, with Roman chains,
 The tidings come of Jesus crucified;
 They come, they spread, the weak, the suffering, hear;
 Receive the faith, and in the hope abide.
