title: The Poet And The Caged Turtledove
---

 As often as I murmur here
 My half-formed melodies,
 Straight from her osier mansion near,
 The Turtledove replies:
 Though silent as a leaf before,
 The captive promptly coos;
 Is it to teach her own soft lore,
 Or second my weak Muse?

 I rather think, the gentle Dove
 Is murmuring a reproof,
 Displeased that I from lays of love
 Have dared to keep aloof;
 That I, a Bard of hill and dale,
 Have caroled, fancy free,
 As if nor dove nor nightingale,
 Had heart or voice for me.

 If such thy meaning, O forbear,
 Sweet Bird! to do me wrong;
 Love, blessed Love, is everywhere
 The spirit of my song:
 'Mid grove, and by the calm fireside,
 Love animates my lyre
 That coo again! 'tis not to chide,
 I feel, but to inspire.
