 Heavenly Archer, bend thy bow;
 Now the flame of life burns low,
 Youth is gone; I, too, would go.

 Even Fortune leads to this:
 Harsh or kind, at last she is
 Murderess of all ecstasies.

 Yet the spirit, dark, alone,
 Bound in sense, still hearkens on
 For tidings of a bliss foregone.

 Sleep is well for dreamless head,
 At no breath astonish�d,
 From the Gardens of the Dead.

 I the immortal harps hear ring,
 By Babylon's river languishing.
 Heavenly Archer, loose thy string.
