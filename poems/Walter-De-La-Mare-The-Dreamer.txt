 O thou who giving helm and sword,
Gav'st, too, the rusting rain,
 And starry dark's all tender dews
 To blunt and stain:

 Out of the battle I am sped,
Unharmed, yet stricken sore;
 A living shape amid whispering shades
 On Lethe's shore.

 No trophy in my hands I bring,
To this sad, sighing stream,
 The neighings and the trumps and cries
 Were but a dream.

 Traitor to life, of life betrayed:
O, of thy mercy deep,
 A dream my all, the all I ask
 Is sleep.
