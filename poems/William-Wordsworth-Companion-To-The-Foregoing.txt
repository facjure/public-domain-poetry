 Never enlivened with the liveliest ray
 That fosters growth or checks or cheers decay,
 Nor by the heaviest rain-drops more deprest,
 This Flower, that first appeared as summer's guest,
 Preserves her beauty 'mid autumnal leaves
 And to her mournful habits fondly cleaves.
 When files of stateliest plants have ceased to bloom,
 One after one submitting to their doom,
 When her coevals each and all are fled,
 What keeps her thus reclined upon her lonesome bed?

 The old mythologists, more impressed than we
 Of this late day by character in tree
 Or herb, that claimed peculiar sympathy,
 Or by the silent lapse of fountain clear,
 Or with the language of the viewless air
 By bird or beast made vocal, sought a cause
 To solve the mystery, not in Nature's laws
 But in Man's fortunes. Hence a thousand tales
 Sung to the plaintive lyre in Grecian vales.
 Nor doubt that something of their spirit swayed
 The fancy-stricken Youth or heart-sick Maid,
 Who, while each stood companionless and eyed
 This undeparting Flower in crimson dyed,
 Thought of a wound which death is slow to cure,
 A fate that has endured and will endure,
 And, patience coveting yet passion feeding,
 Called the dejected Lingerer, 'Loves lies bleeding'.
