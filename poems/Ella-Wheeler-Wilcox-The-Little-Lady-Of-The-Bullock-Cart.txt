Now is the time when India is gay
With wedding parties; and the radiant throngs
Seem like a scattered rainbow taking part
In human pleasures.Dressed in bright array,
They fling upon the bride their wreaths of songs - 
The Little Lady of the Bullock Cart.

Here is the temple ready for the rite:
The large-eyed bullocks halt; and waiting arms
Lift down the bride.All India's curious art
Speaks in the gems with which she is bedight.
And in the robes which hide her sweet alarms - 
The Little Lady of the Bullock Cart.

This is her day of days:her splendid hour
When joy is hers, though love is all unknown.
It has not dawned upon her childish heart.
But human triumph, in a temporal power,
Has crowned her queen upon a one-day throne - 
The Little Lady of the Bullock Cart.

Ah, Little Lady!What will be your fate?
So long, so long, the outward-reaching years:
So brief the joy of this elusive part;
So frail the shoulders for the loads that wait:
So bitter salt the virgin widow's tears - 
O Little Lady of the Bullock cart.
