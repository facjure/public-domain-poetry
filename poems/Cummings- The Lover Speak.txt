Your little voice
						Over the wires came leaping
and I felt suddenly
dizzy
			With the jostling and shouting of merry flowers
wee skipping high-heeled flames
courtesied before my eyes
									or twinkling over to my side
Looked up
with impertinently exquisite faces
floating hands were laid upon me
I was whirled and tossed into delicious dancing
up
Up
with the pale important
								stars and the Humorous
															moon
dear girl
How I was crazy how I cried when I heard
														over time
and tide and death
leaping
Sweetly
	your voice
