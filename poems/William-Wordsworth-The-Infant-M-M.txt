 Unquiet Childhood here by special grace
 Forgets her nature, opening like a flower
 That neither feeds nor wastes its vital power
 In painful struggles. Months each other chase,
 And nought untunes that Infant's voice; no trace
 Of fretful temper sullies her pure cheek;
 Prompt, lively, self-sufficing, yet so meek
 That one enrapt with gazing on her face
 (Which even the placid innocence of death
 Could scarcely make more placid, heaven more bright)
 Might learn to picture, for the eye of faith,
 The Virgin, as she shone with kindred light;
 A nursling couched upon her mother's knee,
 Beneath some shady palm of Galilee.
