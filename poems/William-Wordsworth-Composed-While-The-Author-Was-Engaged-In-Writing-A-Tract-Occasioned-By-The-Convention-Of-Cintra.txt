title: Composed While The Author Was Engaged In Writing A Tract Occasioned By The Convention Of Cintra

Not 'mid the world's vain objects that enslave
The free-born Soul, that World whose vaunted skill
In selfish interest perverts the will,
Whose factions lead astray the wise and brave,
Not there; but in dark wood and rocky cave,
And hollow vale which foaming torrents fill
With omnipresent murmur as they rave
Down their steep beds, that never shall be still:
Here, mighty Nature! in this school sublime
I weigh the hopes and fears of suffering Spain;
For her consult the auguries of time,
And through the human heart explore my way;
And look and listen, gathering, whence I may,
Triumph, and thoughts no bondage can restrain.
