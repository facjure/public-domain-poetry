title: To The Master Of Balliol
---

Dear Master in our classic town,
You, loved by all the younger gown
There at Balliol,
Lay your Plato for one minute down,

II

And read a Grecian tale re-told,
Which, cast in later Grecian mould,
Quintus Calaber
Somewhat lazily handled of old;

III

And on this white midwinter day�
For have the far-off hymns of May,
All her melodies,
All her harmonies echo�d away?�

IV

To-day, before you turn again
To thoughts that lift the soul of men,
Hear my cataract�s
Downward thunder in hollow and glen,

V

Till, led by dream and vague desire,
The woman, gliding toward the pyre,
Find her warrior
Stark and dark in his funeral fire.
