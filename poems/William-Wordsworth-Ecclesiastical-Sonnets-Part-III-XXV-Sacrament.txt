 By chain yet stronger must the Soul be tied:
 One duty more, last stage of this ascent,
 Brings to thy food, mysterious Sacrament!
 The Offspring, haply, at the Parent's side;
 But not till They, with all that do abide
 In Heaven, have lifted up their hearts to laud
 And magnify the glorious name of God,
 Fountain of grace, whose Son for sinners died.
 Ye, who have duly weighed the summons, pause
 No longer; ye, whom to the saving rite
 The Altar calls, come early under laws
 That can secure for you a path of light
 Through gloomiest shade; put on (nor dread its weight)
 Armour divine, and conquer in your cause!
