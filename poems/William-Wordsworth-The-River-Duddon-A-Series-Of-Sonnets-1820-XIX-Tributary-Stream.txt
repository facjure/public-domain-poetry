 My frame hath often trembled with delight
 When hope presented some far-distant good,
 That seemed from heaven descending, like the flood
 Of yon pure waters, from their aery height
 Hurrying, with lordly Duddon to unite;
 Who, 'mid a world of images imprest
 On the calm depth of his transparent breast,
 Appears to cherish most that Torrent white,
 The fairest, softest, liveliest of them all!
 And seldom hath ear listened to a tune
 More lulling than the busy hum of Noon,
 Swoln by that voice, whose murmur musical
 Announces to the thirsty fields a boon
 Dewy and fresh, till showers again shall fall.
