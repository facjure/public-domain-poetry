title: The Good Shepherd With The Kid
---

 He saves the sheep, the goats he doth not save.
 So rang Tertullian's sentence, on the side
 Of that unpitying Phrygian Sect which cried:
 "Him can no fount of fresh forgiveness lave,

 Who sins, once washed by the baptismal wave."
 So spake the fierce Tertullian. But she sighed,
 The infant Church! of love she felt the tide
 Stream on her from her Lord's yet recent grave.

 And then she smiled; and in the Catacombs,
 With eye suffused but heart inspired true,
 On those walls subterranean, where she hid

 Her head in ignominy, death, and tombs,
 She her good Shepherd's hasty image drew
 And on his shoulders, not a lamb, a kid.
