I thank all who have loved me in their hearts,
With thanks and love from mine. Deep thanks to all
Who paused a little near the prison-wall
To hear my music in its louder parts
Ere they went onward, each one to the mart�s
Or temple�s occupation, beyond call.
But thou, who, in my voice�s sink and fall
When the sob took it, thy divinest Art�s
Own instrument didst drop down at thy foot
To harken what I said between my tears, . . .
Instruct me how to thank thee! Oh, to shoot
My soul�s full meaning into future years,
That they should lend it utterance, and salute
Love that endures, from life that disappears!
