title: Sonnets Upon The Punishment Of Death - In Series, 1839 � VI - Ye Brood Of Conscience Spectres!
---

 Ye brood of conscience Spectres! that frequent
 The bad Man's restless walk, and haunt his bed
 Fiends in your aspect, yet beneficent
 In act, as hovering Angels when they spread
 Their wings to guard the unconscious Innocent
 Slow be the Statutes of the land to share
 A laxity that could not but impair
 'Your' power to punish crime, and so prevent.
 And ye, Beliefs! coiled serpent-like about
 The adage on all tongues, "Murder will out,"
 How shall your ancient warnings work for good
 In the full might they hitherto have shown,
 If for deliberate shedder of man's blood
 Survive not Judgment that requires his own?
