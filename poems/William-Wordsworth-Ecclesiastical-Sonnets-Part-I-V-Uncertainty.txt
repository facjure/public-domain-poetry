 Darkness surrounds us; seeking, we are lost
 On Snowdon's wilds, amid Brigantian coves,
 Or where the solitary shepherd roves
 Along the plain of Sarum, by the ghost
 Of Time and shadows of Tradition, crost;
 And where the boatman of the Western Isles
 Slackens his course, to mark those holy piles
 Which yet survive on bleak Iona's coast.
 Nor these, nor monuments of eldest name,
 Nor Taliesin's unforgotten lays,
 Nor characters of Greek or Roman fame,
 To an unquestionable Source have led;
 Enough, if eyes, that sought the fountainhead
 In vain, upon the growing Rill may gaze.
