 And, not in vain embodied to the sight,
 Religion finds even in the stern retreat
 Of feudal sway her own appropriate seat;
 From the collegiate pomps on Windsor's height
 Down to the humbler altar, which the Knight
 And his retainers of the embattled hall
 Seek in domestic oratory small,
 For prayer in stillness, or the chanted rite;
 Then chiefly dear, when foes are planted round,
 Who teach the intrepid guardians of the place
 Hourly exposed to death, with famine worn,
 And suffering under many a perilous wound
 How sad would be their durance, if forlorn
 Of offices dispensing heavenly grace!
