title: The City Rat And The Country Rat.[1]
---

 A city rat, one night,
 Did, with a civil stoop,
 A country rat invite
 To end a turtle soup.

 Upon a Turkey carpet
 They found the table spread,
 And sure I need not harp it
 How well the fellows fed.

 The entertainment was
 A truly noble one;
 But some unlucky cause
 Disturb'd it when begun.

 It was a slight rat-tat,
 That put their joys to rout;
 Out ran the city rat;
 His guest, too, scamper'd out.

 Our rats but fairly quit,
 The fearful knocking ceased.
 'Return we,' cried the cit,
 To finish there our feast.

 'No,' said the rustic rat;
 'To-morrow dine with me.
 I'm not offended at
 Your feast so grand and free, - 

 'For I've no fare resembling;
 But then I eat at leisure,
 And would not swap, for pleasure
 So mix'd with fear and trembling.'
