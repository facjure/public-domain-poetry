title: Bivouac On A Mountain Side
---

I see before me now, a traveling army halting; 
Below, a fertile valley spread, with barns, and the orchards of summer; 
Behind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt in places, rising high; 
Broken, with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes, dingily seen; 
The numerous camp-fires scatter�d near and far, some away up on the mountain;
The shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized flickering; 
And over all, the sky, the sky! far, far out of reach, studded, breaking out, the eternal stars.
