It�s forty in the shade to-day, the spouting eaves declare;
The boulders nose above the drift, the southern slopes are bare;
Hub-deep in slush Apollo�s car swings north along the Zod,
iac. Good luck, the Spring is back, and Pan is on the road!

His house is Gee &amp; Tellus� Sons,, so goes his jest with men,
He sold us Zeus knows what last year; he�ll take us in again.
Disguised behind the livery-team, fur-coated, rubber-shod,
Yet Apis from the bull-pen lows, he knows his brother God!

Now down the lines of tasseled pines the yearning whispers wake,
Pithys of old thy love behold! Come in for Hermes�s sake!
How long since that so-Boston boot with reeling Maenads ran!
Numen adest! Let be the rest. Pipe and we pay, O Pan.

(What though his phlox and hollyhocks ere half a month demised?
What though his ampelopsis clambered not as advertised?
Though every seed was guaranteed and every standard true,
Forget, forgive they did not live! Believe, and buy anew!)

Now o�er a careless knee he flings the painted page abroad,
Such bloom hath never eye beheld this side of Eden Sword;
Such fruit Pomona marks her own, yea, Liber oversees,
That we may reach (one dollar each) the Lost Hesperides!

Serene, assenting, unabashed, he writes our orders down:,
Blue Asphodel on all our paths, a few true bays for crown,
Uncankered bud, immoral flower, and leaves that never fall,
Apples of Gold, of Youth, of Health, and, thank you, Pan, that�s all�.

He�s off along the drifted pent to catch the Windsor train,
And swindle every citizen from Keene to Lake Champlain.
But where his goat�s-hoof cut the crust, beloved, look below,
He�s left us (I�ll forgive him all) the may-flower �neath her snow!
