 'Tis not my voice now speaks; but a bird
 In darkling forest hollows a sweet throat - 
 Pleads on till distant echo too hath heard
 And doubles every note:
 So love that shrouded dwells in mystery
 Would cry and waken thee.

 Thou Solitary, stir in thy still sleep;
 All the night waits thee, yet thou still dream'st on.
 Furtive the shadows that about thee creep,
 And cheat the shining footsteps of the moon:
 Unseal thine eyes, it is my heart that sings,
 And beats in vain its wings.

 Lost in heaven's vague, the stars burn softly through
 The world's dark latticings, we prisoned stray
 Within its lovely labyrinth, and know
 Mute seraphs guard the way
 Even from silence unto speech, from love
 To that self's self it still is dreaming of.
