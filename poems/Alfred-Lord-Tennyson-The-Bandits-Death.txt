To Sir Walter Scott...


O GREAT AND GALLANT SCOTT,
TRUE GENTLEMAN, HEART, BLOOD AND BONE,
I WOULD IT HAD BEEN MY LOT
TO HAVE SEEN THEE, AND HEARD THEE, AND KNOWN.

Sir, do you see this dagger? nay, why do you start aside?
I was not going to stab you, tho� I am the Bandit�s bride.

You have set a price on his head: I may claim it without a lie.
What have I here in the cloth? I will show it you by-and-by.

Sir, I was once a wife. I had one brief summer of bliss.
But the Bandit had woo�d me in vain, and he stabb�d my Piero with this.

And he dragg�d me up there to his cave in the mountain, and there one day
He had left his dagger behind him. I found it. I hid it away.

For he reek�d with the blood of Piero; his kisses were red with his crime,
And I cried to the Saints to avenge me. They heard, they bided their time.

In a while I bore him a son, and he loved to dandle the child,
And that was a link between us; but I�to be reconciled?�

No, by the Mother of God, tho� I think I hated him less,
And�well, if I sinn�d last night, I will find the Priest and confess.

Listen! we three were alone in the dell at the close of the clay.
I was lilting a song to the babe, and it laugh�d like a dawn in May.

Then on a sudden we saw your soldiers crossing the ridge,
And he caught my little one from me: we dipt down under the bridge

By the great dead pine�you know it�and heard as we crouch�d below,
The clatter of arms, and voices, and men passing to and fro.

Black was the night when we crept away�not a star in the sky�
Hush�d as the heart of the grave, till the little one utter�d a cry.

I whisper�d �give it to me,� but he would not answer me�then
He gript it so hard by the throat that the boy never cried again.

We return�d to his cave�the link was broken�he sobb�d and he wept,
And cursed himself; then he yawn�d, for the wretch could sleep, and he slept

Ay, till dawn stole into the cave, and a ray red as blood
Glanced on the strangled face�I could make Sleep Death, if I would�

Glared on at the murder�d son, and the murderous father at rest, . . . 
I drove the blade that had slain my husband thrice thro� his breast.

He was loved at least by his dog: it was chain�d, but its horrible yell
�She has kill�d him, has kill�d him, has kill�d him� rang out all down thro� the dell,

Till I felt I could end myself too with the dagger�so deafen�d and dazed�
Take it, and save me from it ! I fled. I was all but crazed

With the grief that gnaw�d at my heart, and the weight that dragg�d at my hand;
But thanks to the Blessed Saints that I came on none of his band;

And the band will be scatter�d now their gallant captain is dead,
For I with this dagger of his�do you doubt me? Here is his head !
