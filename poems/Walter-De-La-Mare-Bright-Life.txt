 "Come now," I said, "put off these webs of death,
Distract this leaden yearning of thine eyes
From lichened banks of peace, sad mysteries
 Of dust fallen-in where passed the flitting breath:
 Turn thy sick thoughts from him that slumbereth
In mouldered linen to the living skies,
The sun's bright-clouded principalities,
 The salt deliciousness the sea-breeze hath!

 "Lay thy warm hand on earth's cold clods and think
What exquisite greenness sprouts from these to grace
 The moving fields of summer; on the brink
Of arch�d waves the sea-horizon trace,
 Whence wheels night's galaxy; and in silence sink
The pride in rapture of life's dwelling-place!"
