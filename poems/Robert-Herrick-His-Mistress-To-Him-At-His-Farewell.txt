title: His Mistress To Him At His Farewell
---

You may vow I'll not forget
To pay the debt
Which to thy memory stands as due
As faith can seal it you.
Take then tribute of my tears;
So long as I have fears
To prompt me, I shall ever
Languish and look, but thy return see never.
Oh then to lessen my despair,
Print thy lips into(the air,
So by this
Means, I may kiss thy kiss,
When as some kind
Wind
Shall hither waft it: And, in lieu,
My lips shall send a thousand back to you.
