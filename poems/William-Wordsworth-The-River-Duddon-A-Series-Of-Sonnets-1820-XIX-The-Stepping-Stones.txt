 The struggling Rill insensibly is grown
 Into a Brook of loud and stately march,
 Crossed ever and anon by plank or arch;
 And, for like use, lo! what might seem a zone
 Chosen for ornament, stone matched with stone
 In studied symmetry, with interspace
 For the clear waters to pursue their race
 Without restraint. How swiftly have they flown,
 Succeeding, still succeeding! Here the Child
 Puts, when the high-swoln Flood runs fierce and wild,
 His budding courage to the proof; and here
 Declining Manhood learns to note the sly
 And sure encroachments of infirmity,
 Thinking how fast time runs, life's end how near!
