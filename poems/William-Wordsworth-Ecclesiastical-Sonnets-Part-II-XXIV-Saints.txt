 Ye, too, must fly before a chasing hand,
 Angels and Saints, in every hamlet mourned!
 Ah! if the old idolatry be spurned,
 Let not your radiant Shapes desert the Land:
 Her adoration was not your demand,
 The fond heart proffered it, the servile heart;
 And therefore are ye summoned to depart,
 Michael, and thou, St. George, whose flaming brand
 The Dragon quelled; and valiant Margaret
 Whose rival sword a like Opponent slew:
 And rapt Cecilia seraph-haunted Queen
 Of harmony; and weeping Magdalene,
 Who in the penitential desert met
 Gales sweet as those that over Eden blew!
