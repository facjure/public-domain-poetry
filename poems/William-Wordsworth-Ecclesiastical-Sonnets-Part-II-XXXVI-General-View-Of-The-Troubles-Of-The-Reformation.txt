 Aid, glorious Martyrs, from your fields of light,
 Our mortal ken! Inspire a perfect trust
 (While we look round) that Heaven's decrees are just:
 Which few can hold committed to a fight
 That shows, ev'n on its better side, the might
 Of proud Self-will, Rapacity, and Lust,
 'Mid clouds enveloped of polemic dust,
 Which showers of blood seem rather to incite
 Than to allay. Anathemas are hurled
 From both sides; veteran thunders (the brute test
 Of truth) are met by fulminations new
 Tartarean flags are caught at, and unfurled
 Friends strike at friends, the flying shall pursue
 And Victory sickens, ignorant where to rest!
