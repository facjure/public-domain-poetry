title: I Saw Three Witches
---

 I saw three witches
 That bowed down like barley,
 And took to their brooms 'neath a louring sky,
 And, mounting a storm-cloud,
 Aloft on its margin,
 Stood black in the silver as up they did fly.

 I saw three witches
 That mocked the poor sparrows
 They carried in cages of wicker along,
 Till a hawk from his eyrie
 Swooped down like an arrow,
 And smote on the cages, and ended their song.

 I saw three witches
 That sailed in a shallop,
 All turning their heads with a truculent smile,
 Till a bank of green osiers
 Concealed their grim faces,
 Though I heard them lamenting for many a mile.

 I saw three witches
 Asleep in a valley,
 Their heads in a row, like stones in a flood,
 Till the moon, creeping upward,
 Looked white through the valley,
 And turned them to bushes in bright scarlet bud.
