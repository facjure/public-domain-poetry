title: A Commonplace Day
---

 The day is turning ghost,
And scuttles from the kalendar in fits and furtively,
 To join the anonymous host
Of those that throng oblivion; ceding his place, maybe,
 To one of like degree.

 I part the fire-gnawed logs,
Rake forth the embers, spoil the busy flames, and lay the ends
 Upon the shining dogs;
Further and further from the nooks the twilight's stride extends,
 And beamless black impends.

 Nothing of tiniest worth
Have I wrought, pondered, planned; no one thing asking blame or praise,
 Since the pale corpse-like birth
Of this diurnal unit, bearing blanks in all its rays -
 Dullest of dull-hued Days!

 Wanly upon the panes
The rain slides as have slid since morn my colourless thoughts; and yet
 Here, while Day's presence wanes,
And over him the sepulchre-lid is slowly lowered and set,
 He wakens my regret.

 Regret - though nothing dear
That I wot of, was toward in the wide world at his prime,
 Or bloomed elsewhere than here,
To die with his decease, and leave a memory sweet, sublime,
 Or mark him out in Time . . .

 - Yet, maybe, in some soul,
In some spot undiscerned on sea or land, some impulse rose,
 Or some intent upstole
Of that enkindling ardency from whose maturer glows
 The world's amendment flows;

 But which, benumbed at birth
By momentary chance or wile, has missed its hope to be
 Embodied on the earth;
And undervoicings of this loss to man's futurity
 May wake regret in me.
