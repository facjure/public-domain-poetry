I wandered to a crude coast
 Like a ghost;
Upon the hills I saw fires -
 Funeral pyres
Seemingly and heard breaking
Waves like distant cannonades that set the land shaking.

And so I never once guessed
 A Love-nest,
Bowered and candle-lit, lay
 In my way,
Till I found a hid hollow,
Where I burst on her my heart could not but follow.
