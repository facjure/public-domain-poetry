title: The Wishing Gate Destroyed

 'Tis gone, with old belief and dream
 That round it clung, and tempting scheme
 Released from fear and doubt;
 And the bright landscape too must lie,
 By this blank wall, from every eye,
 Relentlessly shut out.

 Bear witness ye who seldom passed
 That opening, but a look ye cast
 Upon the lake below,
 What spirit-stirring power it gained
 From faith which here was entertained,
 Though reason might say no.

 Blest is that ground, where, o'er the springs
 Of history, Glory claps her wings,
 Fame sheds the exulting tear;
 Yet earth is wide, and many a nook
 Unheard of is, like this, a book
 For modest meanings dear.

 It was in sooth a happy thought
 That grafted, on so fair a spot,
 So confident a token
 Of coming good; the charm is fled,
 Indulgent centuries spun a thread,
 Which one harsh day has broken.

 Alas! for him who gave the word;
 Could he no sympathy afford,
 Derived from earth or heaven,
 To hearts so oft by hope betrayed;
 Their very wishes wanted aid
 Which here was freely given?

 Where, for the love-lorn maiden's wound,
 Will now so readily be found
 A balm of expectation?
 Anxious for far-off children, where
 Shall mothers breathe a like sweet air
 Of home-felt consolation?

 And not unfelt will prove the loss
 'Mid trivial care and petty cross
 And each day's shallow grief;
 Though the most easily beguiled
 Were oft among the first that smiled
 At their own fond belief.

 If still the reckless change we mourn,
 A reconciling thought may turn
 To harm that might lurk here,
 Ere judgment prompted from within
 Fit aims, with courage to begin,
 And strength to persevere.

 Not Fortune's slave is Man: our state
 Enjoins, while firm resolves await
 On wishes just and wise.
 That strenuous action follow both,
 And life be one perpetual growth
 Of heaven-ward enterprise.

 So taught, so trained, we boldly face
 All accidents of time and place;
 Whatever props may fail,
 Trust in that sovereign law can spread
 New glory o'er the mountain's head,
 Fresh beauty through the vale.

 That truth informing mind and heart,
 The simplest cottager may part,
 Ungrieved, with charm and spell;
 And yet, lost Wishing-gate, to thee
 The voice of grateful memory
 Shall bid a kind farewell!
