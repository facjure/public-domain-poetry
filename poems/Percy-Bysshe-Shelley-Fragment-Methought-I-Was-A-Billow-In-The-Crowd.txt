title: Fragment: 'Methought I Was A Billow In The Crowd'.
---

Methought I was a billow in the crowd
Of common men, that stream without a shore,
That ocean which at once is deaf and loud;
That I, a man, stood amid many more
By a wayside..., which the aspect bore
Of some imperial metropolis,
Where mighty shapes - pyramid, dome, and tower -
Gleamed like a pile of crags -
