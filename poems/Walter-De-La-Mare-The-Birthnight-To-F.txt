 Dearest, it was a night
 That in its darkness rocked Orion's stars;
 A sighing wind ran faintly white
 Along the willows, and the cedar boughs
 Laid their wide hands in stealthy peace across
 The starry silence of their antique moss:
 No sound save rushing air
 Cold, yet all sweet with Spring,
 And in thy mother's arms, couched weeping there,
 Thou, lovely thing.
