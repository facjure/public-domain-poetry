I say, "She was as good as fair,"
 When standing by her mound;
"Such passing sweetness," I declare,
 "No longer treads the ground."
I say, "What living Love can catch
 Her bloom and bonhomie,
And what in newer maidens match
 Her olden warmth to me!"

- There stands within yon vestry-nook
 Where bonded lovers sign,
Her name upon a faded book
 With one that is not mine.
To him she breathed the tender vow
 She once had breathed to me,
But yet I say, "O love, even now
 Would I had died for thee!"
