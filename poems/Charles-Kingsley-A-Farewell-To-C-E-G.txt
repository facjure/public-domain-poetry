title: A Farewell:  To C. E. G.

My fairest child, I have no song to give you;
 No lark could pipe in skies so dull and gray;
Yet, if you will, one quiet hint I'll leave you,
 For every day.

I'll tell you how to sing a clearer carol
 Than lark who hails the dawn or breezy down
To earn yourself a purer poet's laurel
 Than Shakespeare's crown.

Be good, sweet maid, and let who can be clever;
 Do lovely things, not dream them, all day long;
And so make Life, and Death, and that For Ever,
 One grand sweet song.

February 1, 1856.
