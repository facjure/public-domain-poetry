Eyes aloft over dangerous places,
The children follow where Psyche flies,
And, in the sweat of their upturned faces,
Slash with a net at the empty skies.

So it goes they fall amid brambles,
And sting their toes on the nettle-tops
Till after a thousand scratches and scrambles
They wipe their brows, and the hunting stops.

Then to quiet them comes their father
And stills the riot of pain and grief,
Saying, �Little ones, go and gather
Out of my garden a cabbage leaf.

�You will find on it whorls and clots of
Dull grey eggs that, properly fed,
Turn by way of the worm to lots of
Radiant Psyches raised from the dead.�
. . . . .
�Heaven is beautiful, Earth is ugly,�
The three-dimensioned preacher saith.
So we must not look where the snail and the slug lie
For Psyches birth . . . . And that is our death!
