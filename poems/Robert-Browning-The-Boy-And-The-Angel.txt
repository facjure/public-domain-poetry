Morning, evening, noon and night,
�Praise God!; sang Theocrite.

Then to his poor trade he turned,
Whereby the daily meal was earned.

Hard he laboured, long and well;
O�er his work the boy�s curls fell:

But ever, at each period,
He stopped and sang, �Praise God!�

Then back again his curls he threw,
And cheerful turned to work anew.

Said Blaise, the listening monk, �Well done;
�I doubt not thou art heard, my son:

�As well as if thy voice to-day
�Were praising God, the Pope�s great way.

�This Easter Day, the Pope at Rome
�Praises God from Peter�s dome.�

Said Theocrite, �Would God that I
�Might praise him, that great way, and die!�

Night passed, day shone,
And Theocrite was gone.

With God a day endures alway,
A thousand years are but a day.

God said in heaven, �Nor day nor night
�Now brings the voice of my delight.�

Then Gabriel, like a rainbow�s birth,
Spread his wings and sank to earth;

Entered, in flesh, the empty cell,
Lived there, and played the craftsman well;

And morning, evening, noon and night,
Praised God in place of Theocrite.

And from a boy, to youth he grew:
The man put off the stripling�s hue:

The man matured and fell away
Into the season of decay:

And ever o�er the trade he bent,
And ever lived on earth content.

(He did God�s will; to him, all one
If on the earth or in the sun.)

God said, �A praise is in mine ear;
�There is no doubt in it, no fear:

�So sing old worlds, and so
�New worlds that from my footstool go.

�Clearer loves sound other ways:
�I miss my little human praise.�

Then forth sprang Gabriel�s wings, off fell
The flesh disguise, remained the cell.

�Twas Easter Day: he flew to Rome,
And paused above Saint Peter�s dome.

In the tiring-room close by
The great outer gallery,

With his holy vestments dight,
Stood the new Pope, Theocrite:

And all his past career
Came back upon him clear,

Since when, a boy, he plied his trade,
Till on his life the sickness weighed;

And in his cell, when death drew near,
An angel in a dream brought cheer:

And rising from the sickness drear
He grew a priest, and now stood here.

To the East with praise he turned,
And on his sight the angel burned.

�I bore thee from thy craftsman�s cell,
�And set thee here; I did not well.

�Vainly I left my angel-sphere,
�Vain was thy dream of many a year.

�Thy voice�s praise seemed weak; it dropped,
�Creation�s chorus stopped!

�Go back and praise again
�The early way, while I remain.

�With that weak voice of our disdain,
�Take up Creation�s pausing strain.

�Back to the cell and poor employ:
�Resume the craftsman and the boy!�

Theocrite grew old at home;
A new Pope dwelt in Peter�s dome.

One vanished as the other died:
They sought God side by side.
