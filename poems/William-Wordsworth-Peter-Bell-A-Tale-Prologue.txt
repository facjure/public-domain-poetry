 PROLOGUE

 There's something in a flying horse,
 There's something in a huge balloon;
 But through the clouds I'll never float
 Until I have a little Boat,
 Shaped like the crescent-moon.

 And now I 'have' a little Boat,
 In shape a very crescent-moon
 Fast through the clouds my boat can sail;
 But if perchance your faith should fail,
 Look up and you shall see me soon! 

 The woods, my Friends, are round you roaring,
 Rocking and roaring like a sea;
 The noise of danger's in your ears,
 And ye have all a thousand fears
 Both for my little Boat and me!

 Meanwhile untroubled I admire
 The pointed horns of my canoe;
 And, did not pity touch my breast,
 To see how ye are all distrest,
 Till my ribs ached, I'd laugh at you! 

 Away we go, my Boat and I 
 Frail man ne'er sate in such another;
 Whether among the winds we strive,
 Or deep into the clouds we dive,
 Each is contented with the other.

 Away we go and what care we
 For treasons, tumults, and for wars?
 We are as calm in our delight
 As is the crescent-moon so bright
 Among the scattered stars. 

 Up goes my Boat among the stars
 Through many a breathless field of light,
 Through many a long blue field of ether,
 Leaving ten thousand stars beneath her:
 Up goes my little Boat so bright!

 The Crab, the Scorpion, and the Bull 
 We pry among them all; have shot
 High o'er the red-haired race of Mars,
 Covered from top to toe with scars;
 Such company I like it not! 

 The towns in Saturn are decayed,
 And melancholy Spectres throng them; 
 The Pleiads, that appear to kiss
 Each other in the vast abyss,
 With joy I sail among them.

 Swift Mercury resounds with mirth,
 Great Jove is full of stately bowers;
 But these, and all that they contain,
 What are they to that tiny grain,
 That little Earth of ours? 

 Then back to Earth, the dear green Earth: 
 Whole ages if I here should roam,
 The world for my remarks and me
 Would not a whit the better be;
 I've left my heart at home.

 See! there she is, the matchless Earth!
 There spreads the famed Pacific Ocean!
 Old Andes thrusts yon craggy spear
 Through the grey clouds; the Alps are here,
 Like waters in commotion! 

 Yon tawny slip is Libya's sands;
 That silver thread the river Dnieper!
 And look, where clothed in brightest green
 Is a sweet Isle, of isles the Queen;
 Ye fairies, from all evil keep her!

 And see the town where I was born!
 Around those happy fields we span
 In boyish gambols; I was lost
 Where I have been, but on this coast
 I feel I am a man. 

 Never did fifty things at once
 Appear so lovely, never, never; 
 How tunefully the forests ring!
 To hear the earth's soft murmuring
 Thus could I hang for ever!

 "Shame on you!" cried my little Boat,
 "Was ever such a homesick Loon,
 Within a living Boat to sit,
 And make no better use of it;
 A Boat twin-sister of the crescent-moon! 

 "Ne'er in the breast of full-grown Poet
 Fluttered so faint a heart before; 
 Was it the music of the spheres
 That overpowered your mortal ears?
 Such din shall trouble them no more.

 "These nether precincts do not lack
 Charms of their own; then come with me;
 I want a comrade, and for you
 There's nothing that I would not do;
 Nought is there that you shall not see. 

 "Haste! and above Siberian snows
 We'll sport amid the boreal morning;
 Will mingle with her lustres gliding
 Among the stars, the stars now hiding,
 And now the stars adorning.

 "I know the secrets of a land
 Where human foot did never stray;
 Fair is that land as evening skies,
 And cool, though in the depth it lies
 Of burning Africa. 

 "Or we'll into the realm of Faery,
 Among the lovely shades of things;
 The shadowy forms of mountains bare,
 And streams, and bowers, and ladies fair,
 The shades of palaces and kings!

 "Or, if you thirst with hardy zeal
 Less quiet regions to explore,
 Prompt voyage shall to you reveal
 How earth and heaven are taught to feel
 The might of magic lore!" 

 "My little vagrant Form of light,
 My gay and beautiful Canoe,
 Well have you played your friendly part;
 As kindly take what from my heart
 Experience forces then adieu!

 "Temptation lurks among your words;
 But, while these pleasures you're pursuing
 Without impediment or let,
 No wonder if you quite forget
 What on the earth is doing. 

 "There was a time when all mankind
 Did listen with a faith sincere
 To tuneful tongues in mystery versed;
 'Then' Poets fearlessly rehearsed
 The wonders of a wild career.

 "Go (but the world's a sleepy world,
 And 'tis, I fear, an age too late)
 Take with you some ambitious Youth!
 For, restless Wanderer! I, in truth,
 Am all unfit to be your mate. 

 "Long have I loved what I behold,
 The night that calms, the day that cheers;
 The common growth of mother-earth
 Suffices me her tears, her mirth,
 Her humblest mirth and tears.

 "The dragon's wing, the magic ring,
 I shall not covet for my dower,
 If I along that lowly way
 With sympathetic heart may stray,
 And with a soul of power. 

 "These given, what more need I desire
 To stir, to soothe, or elevate?
 What nobler marvels than the mind
 May in life's daily prospect find,
 May find or there create?

 "A potent wand doth Sorrow wield;
 What spell so strong as guilty Fear!
 Repentance is a tender Sprite;
 If aught on earth have heavenly might,
 'Tis lodged within her silent tear. 

 "But grant my wishes, let us now
 Descend from this ethereal height;
 Then take thy way, adventurous Skiff,
 More daring far than Hippogriff,
 And be thy own delight!

 "To the stone-table in my garden,
 Loved haunt of many a summer hour,
 The Squire is come: his daughter Bess
 Beside him in the cool recess
 Sits blooming like a flower. 

 "With these are many more convened;
 They know not I have been so far; 
 I see them there, in number nine,
 Beneath the spreading Weymouth-pine!
 I see them there they are!

 "There sits the Vicar and his Dame;
 And there my good friend, Stephen Otter;
 And, ere the light of evening fail,
 To them I must relate the Tale
 Of Peter Bell the Potter." 

 Off flew the Boat away she flees,
 Spurning her freight with indignation!
 And I, as well as I was able,
 On two poor legs, toward my stone-table
 Limped on with sore vexation.

 "O, here he is!" cried little Bess 
 She saw me at the garden-door;
 "We've waited anxiously and long,"
 They cried, and all around me throng,
 Full nine of them or more! 

 "Reproach me not your fears be still 
 Be thankful we again have met; 
 Resume, my Friends! within the shade
 Your seats, and quickly shall be paid
 The well-remembered debt."

 I spake with faltering voice, like one
 Not wholly rescued from the pale
 Of a wild dream, or worse illusion;
 But, straight, to cover my confusion,
 Began the promised Tale.
