title: June Bracken And Heather
---

There on the top of the down,
The wild heather round me and over me June�s high blue,
When I look�d at the bracken so bright and the heather so brown,
I thought to myself I would offer this book to you,
This, and my love together,
To you that are seventy-seven,
With a faith as clear as the heights of the June-blue heaven,
And a fancy as summer-new
As the green of the bracken amid the gloom of the heather.
