title: I Know An Aged Man Constrained To Dwell
---

 I know an aged Man constrained to dwell
 In a large house of public charity,
 Where he abides, as in a Prisoner's cell,
 With numbers near, alas! no company.

 When he could creep about, at will, though poor
 And forced to live on alms, this old Man fed
 A Redbreast, one that to his cottage door
 Came not, but in a lane partook his bread.

 There, at the root of one particular tree,
 An easy seat this worn-out Labourer found
 While Robin pecked the crumbs upon his knee
 Laid one by one, or scattered on the ground.

 Dear intercourse was theirs, day after day;
 What signs of mutual gladness when they met!
 Think of their common peace, their simple play,
 The parting moment and its fond regret.

 Months passed in love that failed not to fulfill,
 In spite of season's change, its own demand,
 By fluttering pinions here and busy bill;
 There by caresses from a tremulous hand.

 Thus in the chosen spot a tie so strong
 Was formed between the solitary pair,
 That when his fate had housed him 'mid a throng
 The Captive shunned all converse proffered there.

 Wife, children, kindred, they were dead and gone;
 But, if no evil hap his wishes crossed,
 One living Stay was left, and on that one
 Some recompense for all that he had lost.

 Oh that the good old Man had power to prove,
 By message sent through air or visible token,
 That still he loves the Bird, and still must love;
 That friendship lasts though fellowship is broken!
