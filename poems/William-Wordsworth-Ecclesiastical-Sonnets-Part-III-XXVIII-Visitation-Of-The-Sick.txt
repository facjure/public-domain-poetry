title: Ecclesiastical Sonnets - Part III. - XXVIII - Visitation Of The Sick
---

 The Sabbath bells renew the inviting peal;
 Glad music! yet there be that, worn with pain
 And sickness, listen where they long have lain,
 In sadness listen. With maternal zeal
 Inspired, the Church sends ministers to kneel
 Beside the afflicted; to sustain with prayer,
 And soothe the heart confession hath laid bare
 That pardon, from God's throne, may set its seal
 On a true Penitent. When breath departs
 From one disburthened so, so comforted,
 His Spirit Angels greet; and ours be hope
 That, if the Sufferer rise from his sick-bed,
 Hence he will gain a firmer mind, to cope
 With a bad world, and foil the Tempter's arts.
