 Ye Trees! whose slender roots entwine
 Altars that piety neglects;
 Whose infant arms enclasp the shrine
 Which no devotion now respects;
 If not a straggler from the herd
 Here ruminate, nor shrouded bird,
 Chanting her low-voiced hymn, take pride
 In aught that ye would grace or hide
 How sadly is your love misplaced,
 Fair Trees, your bounty run to waste!

 Ye, too, wild Flowers! that no one heeds,
 And ye, full often spurned as weeds
 In beauty clothed, or breathing sweetness
 From fractured arch and mouldering wall
 Do but more touchingly recall
 Man's headstrong violence and Time's fleetness,
 Making the precincts ye adorn
 Appear to sight still more forlorn.
