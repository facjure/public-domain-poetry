 Yet Truth is keenly sought for, and the wind
 Charged with rich words poured out in thought's defense;
 Whether the Church inspire that eloquence,
 Or a Platonic Piety confined
 To the sole temple of the inward mind;
 And One there is who builds immortal lays,
 Though doomed to tread in solitary ways,
 Darkness before and danger's voice behind;
 Yet not alone, nor helpless to repel
 Sad thoughts; for from above the starry sphere
 Come secrets, whispered nightly to his ear;
 And the pure spirit of celestial light
 Shines through his soul, "that he may see and tell
 Of things invisible to mortal sight."
