 On to Iona! What can she afford
 To 'us' save matter for a thoughtful sigh,
 Heaved over ruin with stability
 In urgent contrast? To diffuse the WORD
 (Thy Paramount, mighty Nature! and Time's Lord)
 Her Temples rose, 'mid pagan gloom; but why,
 Even for a moment, has our verse deplored
 Their wrongs, since they fulfilled their destiny?
 And when, subjected to a common doom
 Of mutability, those far-famed Piles
 Shall disappear from both the sister Isles,
 Iona's Saints, forgetting not past days,
 Garlands shall wear of amaranthine bloom,
 While heaven's vast sea of voices chants their praise.
