 Ward of the Law! dread Shadow of a King!
 Whose realm had dwindled to one stately room;
 Whose universe was gloom immersed in gloom,
 Darkness as thick as life o'er life could fling,
 Save haply for some feeble glimmering
 Of Faith and Hope if thou, by nature's doom,
 Gently hast sunk into the quiet tomb,
 Why should we bend in grief, to sorrow cling,
 When thankfulness were best? Fresh-flowing tears,
 Or, where tears flow not, sigh succeeding sigh,
 Yield to such after-thought the sole reply
 Which justly it can claim. The Nation hears
 In this deep knell, silent for threescore years,
 An unexampled voice of awful memory!
