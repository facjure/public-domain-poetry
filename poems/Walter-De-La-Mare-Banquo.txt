 What dost thou here far from thy native place?
 What piercing influences of heaven have stirred
 Thy heart's last mansion all-corruptible to wake,
 To move, and in the sweets of wine and fire
 Sit tempting madness with unholy eyes?
 Begone, thou shuddering, pale anomaly!
 The dark presses without on yew and thorn;
 Stoops now the owl upon her lonely quest;
 The pomp runs high here, and our beauteous women
 Seek no cold witness - O, let murder cry,
 Too shrill for human ear, only to God.
 Come not in power to wreak so wild a vengeance!
 Thou knowest not now the limit of man's heart;
 He is beyond thy knowledge. Gaze not then,
 Horror enthroned lit with insanest light!
