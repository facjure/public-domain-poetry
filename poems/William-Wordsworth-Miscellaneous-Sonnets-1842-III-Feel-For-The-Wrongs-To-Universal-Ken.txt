title: Miscellaneous Sonnets, 1842 - III - Feel For The Wrongs To Universal Ken
---

 Feel for the wrongs to universal ken
 Daily exposed, woe that unshrouded lies;
 And seek the Sufferer in his darkest den,
 Whether conducted to the spot by sighs
 And moanings, or he dwells (as if the wren
 Taught him concealment) hidden from all eyes
 In silence and the awful modesties
 Of sorrow; feel for all, as brother Men!
 Rest not in hope want's icy chain to thaw
 By casual boons and formal charities;
 Learn to be just, just through impartial law;
 Far as ye may, erect and equalise;
 And, what ye cannot reach by statute, draw
 Each from his fountain of self-sacrifice!
