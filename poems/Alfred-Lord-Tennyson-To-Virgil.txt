I.

Roman Virgil, thou that singest
Ilion�s lofty temples robed in fire,
Ilion falling, Rome arising,
wars, and filial faith, and Dido�s pyre;

II.

Landscape-lover, lord of language
more than he that sang the �Works and Days,�
All the chosen coin of fancy
flashing out from many a golden phrase;

III.

Thou that singest wheat and woodland,
tilth and vineyard, hive and horse and herd;
All the charm of all the Muses
often flowering in a lonely word;

IV.

Poet of the happy Tityrus
piping underneath his beechen bowers;
Poet of the poet-satyr
whom the laughing shepherd bound with flowers;

V.

Chanter of the Pollio, glorying
in the blissful years again to be,
Summers of the snakeless meadow,
unlaborious earth and oarless sea;

VI.

Thou that se�st Universal
Nature moved by Universal Mind;
Thou majestic in thy sadness
at the doubtful doom of human kind;

VII.

Light among the vanish�d ages;
star that gildest yet this phantom shore;
Golden branch amid the shadows,
kings and realms that pass to rise no more;

VIII.

Now thy Forum roars no longer,
fallen every purple C�sar�s dome�
Tho� thine ocean-roll of rhythm
sound forever of Imperial Rome�

IX.

Now the Rome of slaves hath perish�d,
and the Rome of freemen holds her place,
I, from out the Northern Island
sunder�d once from all the human race,

X.

I salute thee, Mantovano,
I that loved thee since my day began,
Wielder of the stateliest measure
ever moulded by the lips of man.
