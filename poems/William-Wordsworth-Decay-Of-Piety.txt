title: Decay Of Piety
---

 Oft have I seen, ere Time had ploughed my cheek,
 Matrons and Sires who, punctual to the call
 Of their loved Church, on fast or festival
 Through the long year the house of Prayer would seek:
 By Christmas snows, by visitation bleak
 Of Easter winds, unscared, from hut or hall
 They came to lowly bench or sculptured stall,
 But with one fervour of devotion meek.
 I see the places where they once were known,
 And ask, surrounded even by kneeling crowds,
 Is ancient Piety for ever flown?
 Alas! even then they seemed like fleecy clouds
 That, struggling through the western sky, have won
 Their pensive light from a departed sun!
