title: Music Unheard

 Sweet sounds, begone - 
 Whose music on my ear
 Stirs foolish discontent
 Of lingering here;
 When, if I crossed
 The crystal verge of death,
 Him I should see
 Who these sounds murmureth.

 Sweet sounds, begone - 
 Ask not my heart to break
 Its bond of bravery for
 Sweet quiet's sake;
 Lure not my feet
 To leave the path they must
 Tread on, unfaltering,
 Till I sleep in dust.

 Sweet sounds, begone:
 Though silence brings apace
 Deadly disquiet
 Of this homeless place;
 And all I love
 In beauty cries to me,
 'We but vain shadows
 And reflections be.'
