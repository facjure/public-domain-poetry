He thought he saw an Elephant
That practiced on a fife:
He looked again, and found it was
A letter from his wife.
�At length I realize,� he said,
�The bitterness of life!�

He thought he saw a Buffalo
Upon the chimney-piece:
He looked again, and found it was
His Sister�s Husband�s Niece.
�Unless you leave this house,� he said,
�I�ll send for the police!�

he thought he saw a Rattlesnake
That questioned him in Greek:
He looked again, and found it was
The Middle of Next Week.
�The one thing I regret,� he said,
�Is that it cannot speak!�

He thought he saw a Banker�s Clerk
Descending from the bus:
He looked again, and found it was
A Hippopotamus.
�If this should stay to dine,� he said,
�There won�t be much for us!�

He thought he saw a Kangaroo
That worked a Coffee-mill:
He looked again, and found it was
A Vegetable-Pill.
�Were I to swallow this,� he said,
�I should be very ill!�

He thought he saw a Coach-and-Four
That stood beside his bed:
He looked again, and found it was
A Bear without a Head.
�Poor thing,� he said, �poor silly thing!
It�s waiting to be fed!�
