title: To Alfred Tennyson, My Grandson

Golden-hair�d Ally whose name is one with mine,
Crazy with laughter and babble and earth�s new wine,
Now that the flower of a year and a half is thine,
O little blossom, O mine, and mine of mine,
Glorious poet who never hast written a line,
Laugh, for the name at the head of my verse is thine.
May�st thou never be wrong�d by the name that is mine!
