 'Once ... once upon a time ...'
Over and over again,
 Martha would tell us her stories,
In the hazel glen.

 Hers were those clear grey eyes
You watch, and the story seems
 Told by their beautifulness
Tranquil as dreams.

 She'd sit with her two slim hands
Clasped round her bended knees;
 While we on our elbows lolled,
And stared at ease.

 Her voice and her narrow chin,
Her grave small lovely head,
 Seemed half the meaning
Of the words she said.

 'Once ... once upon a time ...'
Like a dream you dream in the night,
 Fairies and gnomes stole out
In the leaf-green light.

 And her beauty far away
Would fade, as her voice ran on,
 Till hazel and summer sun
And all were gone: - 

 All fordone and forgot;
And like clouds in the height of the sky,
 Our hearts stood still in the hush
Of an age gone by.
