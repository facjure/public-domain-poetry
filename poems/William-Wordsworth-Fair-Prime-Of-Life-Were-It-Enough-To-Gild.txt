title: Fair Prime Of Life! Were It Enough To Gild
---

 Fair Prime of life! were it enough to gild
 With ready sunbeams every straggling shower;
 And, if an unexpected cloud should lower,
 Swiftly thereon a rainbow arch to build
 For Fancy's errands, then, from fields half-tilled
 Gathering green weeds to mix with poppy flower,
 Thee might thy Minions crown, and chant thy power,
 Unpitied by the wise, all censure stilled.
 Ah! show that worthier honours are thy due;
 Fair Prime of life! arouse the deeper heart;
 Confirm the Spirit glorying to pursue
 Some path of steep ascent and lofty aim;
 And, if there be a joy that slights the claim
 Of grateful memory, bid that joy depart.
