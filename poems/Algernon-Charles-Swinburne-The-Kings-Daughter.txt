title: The King�s Daughter
---

We were ten maidens in the green corn,
Small red leaves in the mill-water:
Fairer maidens never were born,
Apples of gold for the king�s daughter.

We were ten maidens by a well-head,
Small white birds in the mill-water:
Sweeter maidens never were wed,
Rings of red for the king�s daughter.

The first to spin, the second to sing,
Seeds of wheat in the mill-water;
The third may was a goodly thing,
White bread and brown for the king�s daughter.

The fourth to sew and the fifth to play,
Fair green weed in the mill-water;
The sixth may was a goodly may,
White wine and red for the king�s daughter.

The seventh to woo, the eighth to wed,
Fair thin reeds in the mill-water;
The ninth had gold work on her head,
Honey in the comb for the king�s daughter.

The ninth had gold work round her hair,
Fallen flowers in the mill-water;
The tenth may was goodly and fair,
Golden gloves for the king�s daughter.

We were ten maidens in a field green,
Fallen fruit in the mill-water;
Fairer maidens never have been,
Golden sleeves for the king�s daughter.

By there comes the king�s young son,
A little wind in the mill-water;
�Out of ten maidens ye�ll grant me one,�
A crown of red for the king�s daughter.

�Out of ten mays ye�ll give me the best,�
A little rain in the mill-water;
A bed of yellow straw for all the rest,
A bed of gold for the king�s daughter.

He�s ta�en out the goodliest,
Rain that rains in the mill-water;
A comb of yellow shell for all the rest,
A comb of gold for the king�s daughter.

He�s made her bed to the goodliest,
Wind and hail in the mill-water;
A grass girdle for all the rest,
A girdle of arms for the king�s daughter.

He�s set his heart to the goodliest,
Snow that snows in the mill-water;
Nine little kisses for all the rest,
An hundredfold for the king�s daughter.

He�s ta�en his leave at the goodliest,
Broken boats in the mill-water;
Golden gifts for all the rest,
Sorrow of heart for the king�s daughter.

�Ye�ll make a grave for my fair body,�
Running rain in the mill-water;
�And ye�ll streek my brother at the side of me,�
The pains of hell for the king�s daughter.
