"Are you deaf, Father William!" the young man said,
"Did you hear what I told you just now?"
"Excuse me for shouting! Don't waggle your head"
"Like a blundering, sleepy old cow!"
"A little maid dwelling in Wallington Town,"
"Is my friend, so I beg to remark:"
"Do you think she'd be pleased if a book were sent down"
"Entitled 'The Hunt of the Snark?'"


"Pack it up in brown paper!" the old man cried,
"And seal it with olive-and-dove."
"I command you to do it!" he added with pride,
"Nor forget, my good fellow to send her beside"
"Easter Greetings, and give her my love."
