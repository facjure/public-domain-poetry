 Mine is a body that should die at sea!
 And have for a grave, instead of a grave
 Six feet deep and the length of me,
 All the water that is under the wave!

 And terrible fishes to seize my flesh,
 Such as a living man might fear,
 And eat me while I am firm and fresh,--
 Not wait till I've been dead for a year!
