I

As newer comers crowd the fore,
 We drop behind.
- We who have laboured long and sore
 Times out of mind,
And keen are yet, must not regret
 To drop behind.

II

Yet there are of us some who grieve
 To go behind;
Staunch, strenuous souls who scarce believe
 Their fires declined,
And know none cares, remembers, spares
 Who go behind.

III

'Tis not that we have unforetold
 The drop behind;
We feel the new must oust the old
 In every kind;
But yet we think, must we, must WE,
 Too, drop behind?
