 The Spirit of Antiquity, enshrined
 In sumptuous buildings, vocal in sweet song,
 In picture, speaking with heroic tongue,
 And with devout solemnities entwined,
 Mounts to the seat of grace within the mind:
 Hence Forms that glide with swan-like ease along,
 Hence motions, even amid the vulgar throng,
 To an harmonious decency confined:
 As if the streets were consecrated ground,
 The city one vast temple, dedicate
 To mutual respect in thought and deed;
 To leisure, to forbearances sedate;
 To social cares from jarring passions freed;
 A deeper peace than that in deserts found!
