 I left my home for travelling;
 Because I heard the strange birds sing
 In foreign skies, and felt their wing

 Brush past my soul impatiently;
 I saw the bloom on flower and tree
 That only grows beyond the sea.

 Methought the distant voices spake
 More wisdom than near tongues can make;
 I followed-lest my heart should break.

 And what is past is past and done.
 I dreamt, and here the dream begun:
 I saw a salmon in the sun

 Leap from the river to the shore-
 Ah! strange mishap, so wounded sore,
 To his sweet stream to turn no more.

 A bird from �neath his mother�s breast,
 Spread his weak wings in vain request;
 Never again to reach his nest.

 I saw a blossom bloom too soon
 Upon a summer�s afternoon;
 �Twill breathe no more beneath the moon.

 I woke, warmed �neath a foreign sky
 Where locust blossoms bud and die,
 Strange birds called to me flashing by.

 And dusky faces passed and woke
 The echoes with the words they spoke-
 -The same old tales as other folk.

 A truce to roaming!Never more
 I�ll leave the home I loved of yore.
 But strangers meet me at the door.

 * * * * *

 I left my home still travelling,
 For yet I hear the strange birds sing,
 And foreign flowers rare perfumes bring.

 I hear a distant voice, more wise
 Than others are �neath foreign skies.
 I�ll find-perhaps in paradise.
