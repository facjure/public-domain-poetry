 And what melodious sounds at times prevail!
 And, ever and anon, how bright a gleam
 Pours on the surface of the turbid Stream!
 What heartfelt fragrance mingles with the gale
 That swells the bosom of our passing sail!
 For where, but on 'this' River's margin, blow
 Those flowers of chivalry, to bind the brow
 Of hardihood with wreaths that shall not fail?
 Fair Court of Edward! wonder of the world!
 I see a matchless blazonry unfurled
 Of wisdom, magnanimity, and love;
 And meekness tempering honourable pride;
 The lamb is couching by the lion's side,
 And near the flame-eyed eagle sits the dove.
