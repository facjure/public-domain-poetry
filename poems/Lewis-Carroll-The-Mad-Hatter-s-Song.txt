 "it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing
`Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what you're at!'You know the song, perhaps?" "I've heard something like it," said Alice. "It goes on, you know," the Hatter continued,
"in this way:
`Up above the world you fly,
Like a teatray in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle '"
