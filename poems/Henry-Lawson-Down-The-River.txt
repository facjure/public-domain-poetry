I�ve done with joys an� misery,
An� why should I repine?
There�s no one knows the past but me
An� that ol� dog o� mine.
We camp an� walk an� camp an� walk,
An� find it fairly good;
He can do anything but talk,
An� he wouldn�t if he could.

We sits an� thinks beside the fire,
With all the stars a-shine,
An� no one knows our thoughts but me
An� that there dog o� mine.
We has our Johnny-cake an� �scrag,�
An� finds �em fairly good;
He can do anything but talk,
An� he wouldn�t if he could.

He gets a �possum now an� then,
I cooks it on the fire;
He has his water, me my tea,
What more could we desire?
He gets a rabbit when he likes,
We finds it pretty good;
He can do anything but talk,
An� he wouldn�t if he could.

I has me smoke, he has his rest,
When sunset�s gettin� dim;
An� if I do get drunk at times,
It�s all the same to him.
So long�s he�s got me swag to mind,
He thinks that times is good;
He can do anything but talk,
An� he wouldn�t if he could.

He gets his tucker from the cook,
For cook is good to him,
An� when I sobers up a bit,
He goes an� has a swim.
He likes the rivers where I fish,
An� all the world is good;
He can do anything but talk,
An� he wouldn�t if he could.
