 As indignation mastered grief, my tongue
 Spake bitter words; words that did ill agree
 With those rich stores of Nature's imagery,
 And divine Art, that fast to memory clung
 Thy gifts, magnificent Region, ever young
 In the sun's eye, and in his sister's sight
 How beautiful! how worthy to be sung
 In strains of rapture, or subdued delight!
 I feign not; witness that unwelcome shock
 That followed the first sound of German speech,
 Caught the far-winding barrier Alps among.
 In that announcement, greeting seemed to mock
 Parting; the casual word had power to reach
 My heart, and filled that heart with conflict strong.
