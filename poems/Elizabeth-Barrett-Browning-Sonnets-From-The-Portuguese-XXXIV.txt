With the same heart, I said, I�ll answer thee
As those, when thou shalt call me by my name,
Lo, the vain promise! is the same, the same,
Perplexed and ruffled by life�s strategy?
When called before, I told how hastily
I dropped my flowers or brake off from a game.
To run and answer with the smile that came
At play last moment, and went on with me
Through my obedience. When I answer now,
I drop a grave thought, break from solitude;
Yet still my heart goes to thee, ponder how,
Not as to a single good, but all my good!
Lay thy hand on it, best one, and allow
That no child�s foot could run fast as this blood.
