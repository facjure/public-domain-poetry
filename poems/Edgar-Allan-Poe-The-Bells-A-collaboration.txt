 The bells! ah, the bells!
 The little silver bells!
 How fairy-like a melody there floats
 From their throats. 
 From their merry little throats 
 From the silver, tinkling throats
 Of the bells, bells, bells 
 Of the bells!

 The bells! ah, the bells!
 The heavy iron bells!
 How horrible a monody there floats
 From their throats 
 From their deep-toned throats 
 From their melancholy throats!
 How I shudder at the notes
 Of the bells, bells, bells 
 Of the bells!
