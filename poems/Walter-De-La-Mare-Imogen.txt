 Even she too dead! all languor on her brow,
 All mute humanity's last simpleness, - 
 And yet the roses in her cheeks unfallen!
 Can death haunt silence with a silver sound?
 Can death, that hushes all music to a close,
 Pluck one sweet wire scarce-audible that trembles,
 As if a little child, called Purity,
 Sang heedlessly on of his dear Imogen?
 Surely if some young flowers of Spring were put
 Into the tender hollow of her heart,
 'Twould faintly answer, trembling in their petals.
 Poise but a wild bird's feather, it will stir
 On lips that even in silence wear the badge
 Only of truth. Let but a cricket wake,
 And sing of home, and bid her lids unseal
 The unspeakable hospitality of her eyes.
 O childless soul - call once her husband's name!
 And even if indeed from these green hills
 Of England, far, her spirit flits forlorn,
 Back to its youthful mansion it will turn,
 Back to the floods of sorrow these sweet locks
 Yet heavy bear in drops; and Night shall see
 Unwearying as her stars still Imogen,
 Pausing 'twixt death and life on one hushed word.
