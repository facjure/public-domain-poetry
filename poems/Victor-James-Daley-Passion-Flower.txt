Choose who will the wiser part,
I have held her heart to heart;

And have felt her heart-strings stirred,
And her soul�s still singing heard

For one golden-haloed hour
Of Love�s life the passion-flower.

So the world may roll or rest,
I have tasted of its best;

And shall laugh while I have breath
At thy dart and thee, O Death!
