title: The Leaves That Rustled On This Oak-Crowned Hill
---

 The leaves that rustled on this oak-crowned hill,
 And sky that danced among those leaves, are still;
 Rest smooths the way for sleep; in field and bower
 Soft shades and dews have shed their blended power
 On drooping eyelid and the closing flower;
 Sound is there none at which the faintest heart
 Might leap, the weakest nerve of superstition start;
 Save when the Owlet's unexpected scream
 Pierces the ethereal vault; and ('mid the gleam
 Of unsubstantial imagery, the dream,
 From the hushed vale's realities, transferred
 To the still lake) the imaginative Bird
 Seems, 'mid inverted mountains, not unheard.
 
 Grave Creature! whether, while the moon shines bright
 On thy wings opened wide for smoothest flight,
 Thou art discovered in a roofless tower,
 Rising from what may once have been a lady's bower;
 Or spied where thou sitt'st moping in thy mew
 At the dim centre of a churchyard yew;
 Or, from a rifted crag or ivy tod
 Deep in a forest, thy secure abode,
 Thou giv'st, for pastime's sake, by shriek or shout,
 A puzzling notice of thy whereabout
 May the night never come, nor day be seen,
 When I shall scorn thy voice or mock thy mien!
 
 In classic ages men perceived a soul
 Of sapience in thy aspect, headless Owl!
 Thee Athens reverenced in the studious grove;
 And, near the golden sceptre grasped by Jove,
 His Eagle's favourite perch, while round him sate
 The Gods revolving the decrees of Fate,
 Thou, too, wert present at Minerva's side:
 Hark to that second larum! far and wide
 The elements have heard, and rock and cave replied.
