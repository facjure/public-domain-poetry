 "Thin Rain, whom are you haunting,
 That you haunt my door?"
 --Surely it is not I she's wanting;
 Someone living here before--
 "Nobody's in the house but me:
 You may come in if you like and see."

 Thin as thread, with exquisite fingers,--
 Have you seen her, any of you?--
 Grey shawl, and leaning on the wind,
 And the garden showing through?

 Glimmering eyes,--and silent, mostly,
 Sort of a whisper, sort of a purr,
 Asking something, asking it over,
 If you get a sound from her.--

 Ever see her, any of you?--
 Strangest thing I've ever known,--
 Every night since I moved in,
 And I came to be alone.

 "Thin Rain, hush with your knocking!
 You may not come in!
 This is I that you hear rocking;
 Nobody's with me, nor has been!"

 Curious, how she tried the window,--
 Odd, the way she tries the door,--
 Wonder just what sort of people
 Could have had this house before . . .
