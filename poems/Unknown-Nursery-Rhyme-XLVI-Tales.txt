[The tale of Simple Simon forms one of the chap-books, but the following verses are those generally sung in the nursery.]

Simple Simon met a pieman
Going to the fair;
Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
"Let me taste your ware."

Says the pieman to Simple Simon,
"Show me first your penny."
Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
"Indeed I have not any."

Simple Simon went a fishing
For to catch a whale:
All the water he had got
Was in his mother's pail.
