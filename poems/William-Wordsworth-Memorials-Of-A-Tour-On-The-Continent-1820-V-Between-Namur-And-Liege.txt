 What lovelier home could gentle Fancy choose?
 Is this the stream, whose cities, heights, and plains,
 War's favourite playground, are with crimson stains
 Familiar, as the Morn with pearly dews?
 The Morn, that now, along the silver Meuse,
 Spreading her peaceful ensigns, calls the swains
 To tend their silent boats and ringing wains,
 Or strip the bough whose mellow fruit bestrews
 The ripening corn beneath it. As mine eyes
 Turn from the fortified and threatening hill,
 How sweet the prospect of yon watery glade,
 With its grey rocks clustering in pensive shade
 That, shaped like old monastic turrets, rise
 From the smooth meadow-ground, serene and still!
