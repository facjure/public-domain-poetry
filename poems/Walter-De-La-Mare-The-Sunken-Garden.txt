 Speak not - whisper not;
 Here bloweth thyme and bergamot;
 Softly on the evening hour,
 Secret herbs their spices shower.
 Dark-spiked rosemary and myrrh,
 Lean-stalked, purple lavender;
 Hides within her bosom, too,
 All her sorrows, bitter rue.

 Breathe not - trespass not;
 Of this green and darkling spot,
 Latticed from the moon's beams,
 Perchance a distant dreamer dreams;
 Perchance upon its darkening air,
 The unseen ghosts of children fare,
 Faintly swinging, sway and sweep,
 Like lovely sea-flowers in its deep;
 While, unmoved, to watch and ward,
 Amid its gloomed and daisied sward,
 Stands with bowed and dewy head
 That one little leaden Lad.
