I want to be lighting my pipe on deck,
With my baggage safe below,
I want to be free of the crowded quay,
While the steamer�s swinging slow.
I want to be free of treachery,
And of sordid joys and griefs,
To be out of sight of the faces white,
And the waving of handkerchiefs.
I want to be making my ship-board friends,
I want to be free of the past,
I want to be laughing with kindred souls,
While the Heads are opening fast.
I want to be sailing far to-day,
On the tracks where the rovers go,
To feel the heave of the deck, and draw
The breath that the rovers know.
