 Lo! in the burning west, the craggy nape
 Of a proud Ararat! and, thereupon,
 The Ark, her melancholy voyage done!
 Yon rampant cloud mimics a lion's shape;
 There, combats a huge crocodile agape
 A golden spear to swallow! and that brown
 And massy grove, so near yon blazing town,
 Stirs and recedes, destruction to escape!
 Yet all is harmless, as the Elysian shades
 Where Spirits dwell in undisturbed repose
 Silently disappears, or quickly fades:
 Meek Nature's evening comment on the shows
 That for oblivion take their daily birth
 From all the fuming vanities of Earth!
