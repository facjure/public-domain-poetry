Child, were I king, I'd yield my royal rule,
 My chariot, sceptre, vassal-service due,
My crown, my porphyry-basined waters cool,
My fleets, whereto the sea is but a pool,
 For a glance from you!

Love, were I God, the earth and its heaving airs,
 Angels, the demons abject under me,
Vast chaos with its teeming womby lairs,
Time, space, all would I give - aye, upper spheres,
 For a kiss from thee!
