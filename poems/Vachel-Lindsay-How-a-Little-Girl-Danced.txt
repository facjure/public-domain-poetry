Dedicated to Lucy Bates

(Being a reminiscence of certain private theatricals.)



 Oh, cabaret dancer, I know a dancer,
 Whose eyes have not looked on the feasts that are vain.
 I know a dancer, I know a dancer,
 Whose soul has no bond with the beasts of the plain:
 Judith the dancer, Judith the dancer,
 With foot like the snow, and with step like the rain.

 Oh, thrice-painted dancer, vaudeville dancer,
 Sad in your spangles, with soul all astrain,
 I know a dancer, I know a dancer,
 Whose laughter and weeping are spiritual gain,
 A pure-hearted, high-hearted maiden evangel,
 With strength the dark cynical earth to disdain.

 Flowers of bright Broadway, you of the chorus,
 Who sing in the hope of forgetting your pain:
 I turn to a sister of Sainted Cecilia,
 A white bird escaping the earth's tangled skein: - 
 The music of God is her innermost brooding,
 The whispering angels her footsteps sustain.

 Oh, proud Russian dancer:praise for your dancing.
 No clean human passion my rhyme would arraign.
 You dance for Apollo with noble devotion,
 A high cleansing revel to make the heart sane.
 But Judith the dancer prays to a spirit
 More white than Apollo and all of his train.

 I know a dancer who finds the true Godhead,
 Who bends o'er a brazier in Heaven's clear plain.
 I know a dancer, I know a dancer,
 Who lifts us toward peace, from this earth that is vain:
 Judith the dancer, Judith the dancer,
 With foot like the snow, and with step like the rain.
