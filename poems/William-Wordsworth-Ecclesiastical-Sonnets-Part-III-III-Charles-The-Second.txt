 Who comes with rapture greeted, and caressed
 With frantic love, his kingdom to regain?
 Him Virtue's Nurse, Adversity, in vain
 Received, and fostered in her iron breast:
 For all she taught of hardiest and of best,
 Or would have taught, by discipline of pain
 And long privation, now dissolves amain,
 Or is remembered only to give zest
 To wantonness. Away, Circean revels!
 But for what gain? if England soon must sink
 Into a gulf which all distinction levels
 That bigotry may swallow the good name,
 And, with that draught, the life-blood: misery, shame,
 By Poets loathed; from which Historians shrink!
