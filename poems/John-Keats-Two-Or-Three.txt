Two or three Posies
With two or three simples,
Two or three Noses
With two or three pimples,
Two or three wise men
And two or three ninny's,
Two or three guineas,
Two or three raps
At two or three doors,
Two or three naps
Of two or three hours,
Two or three Cats
And two or three mice,
Two or three sprats
At a very great price,
Two or three sandies
And two or three tabbies,
Two or three dandies
And two Mrs. ---
Two or three Smiles
And two or three frowns,
Two or three Miles
To two or three towns,
Two or three pegs
For two or three bonnets,
Two or three dove eggs
To hatch into sonnets.
