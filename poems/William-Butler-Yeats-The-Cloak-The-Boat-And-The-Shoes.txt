author: William Butler Yeats 
title: The Cloak, The Boat, And The Shoes
---

"What do you make so fair and bright?"
"I make the cloak of Sorrow:
O lovely to see in all men's sight
Shall be the cloak of Sorrow,
In all men's sight."
"What do you build with sails for flight?"
"I build a boat for Sorrow:
O swift on the seas all day and night
Saileth the rover Sorrow,
All day and night."
What do you weave with wool so white?"
"I weave the shoes of Sorrow:
Soundless shall be the footfall light
In all men's ears of Sorrow,
Sudden and light."
