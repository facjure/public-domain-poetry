Thou who, when fears attack,
Bid'st them avaunt, and Black
Care, at the horseman's back
 Perching, unseatest;
Sweet when the morn is grey;
Sweet, when they've cleared away
Lunch; and at close of day
 Possibly sweetest:

I have a liking old
For thee, though manifold
Stories, I know, are told,
 Not to thy credit;
How one (or two at most)
Drops make a cat a ghost -
Useless, except to roast -
 Doctors have said it:

How they who use fusees
All grow by slow degrees
Brainless as chimpanzees,
 Meagre as lizards;
Go mad, and beat their wives;
Plunge (after shocking lives)
Razors and carving knives
 Into their gizzards.

Confound such knavish tricks!
Yet know I five or six
Smokers who freely mix
 Still with their neighbours;
Jones - who, I'm glad to say,
Asked leave of Mrs. J.) -
Daily absorbs a clay
 After his labours.

Cats may have had their goose
Cooked by tobacco-juice;
Still why deny its use
 Thoughtfully taken?
We're not as tabbies are:
Smith, take a fresh cigar!
Jones, the tobacco-jar!
 Here's to thee, Bacon!
