When friends are listening round me, Jack, to hear my dying breath,
And I am lying in a sleep they say will end in death,
Don�t notice what the doctor says, and let the nurse complain,
I�ll tell you how to rouse me if I�ll ever wake again.

Just you bring in your fiddle, Jack, and set your heart in tune,
And strike up �Annie Laurie�, or �The Rising of the Moon�;
And if you see no token of a rising in my throat,
You�ll need to brace your mouth, old man�I�m booked by Charon�s boat.

And if you are not satisfied that I am off the scene,
Strike up �The Marseillaise�, or else �The Wearing of the Green�;
And should my fingers tremble not, then I have crossed the line,
But keep your fingers steady, Jack, and strike up �Auld Lang Syne�.
