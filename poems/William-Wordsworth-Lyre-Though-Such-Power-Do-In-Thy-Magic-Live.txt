title: Lyre! Though Such Power Do In Thy Magic Live

 Lyre! though such power do in thy magic live
 As might from India's farthest plain
 Recall the not unwilling Maid,
 Assist me to detain
 The lovely Fugitive:
 Check with thy notes the impulse which, betrayed
 By her sweet farewell looks, I longed to aid.
 Here let me gaze enrapt upon that eye,
 The impregnable and awe-inspiring fort
 Of contemplation, the calm port
 By reason fenced from winds that sigh
 Among the restless sails of vanity.
 But if no wish be hers that we should part,
 A humbler bliss would satisfy my heart.
 Where all things are so fair,
 Enough by her dear side to breathe the air
 Of this Elysian weather;
 And, on or in, or near, the brook, espy
 Shade upon the sunshine lying
 Faint and somewhat pensively;
 And downward Image gaily vying
 With its upright living tree
 'Mid silver clouds, and openings of blue sky
 As soft almost and deep as her cerulean eye.

 Nor less the joy with many a glance
 Cast up the Stream or down at her beseeching,
 To mark its eddying foam-balls prettily distrest
 By ever-changing shape and want of rest;
 Or watch, with mutual teaching,
 The current as it plays
 In flashing leaps and stealthy creeps
 Adown a rocky maze;
 Or note (translucent summer's happiest chance!)
 In the slope-channel floored with pebbles bright,
 Stones of all hues, gem emulous of gem,
 So vivid that they take from keenest sight
 The liquid veil that seeks not to hide them.
