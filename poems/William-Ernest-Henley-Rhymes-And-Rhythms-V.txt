Why, my heart, do we love her so?
 (Geraldine, Geraldine!)
Why does the great sea ebb and flow?
 Why does the round world spin?
Geraldine, Geraldine,
 Bid me my life renew,
What is it worth unless I win,
 Love, love and you?

Why, my heart, when we speak her name
 (Geraldine, Geraldine!),
Throbs the word like a flinging flame?
 Why does the spring begin?
Geraldine, Geraldine,
 Bid me indeed to be,
Open your heart and take us in,
 Love, love and me.
