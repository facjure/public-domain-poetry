 What aim had they, the Pair of Monks, in size
 Enormous, dragged, while side by side they sate,
 By panting steers up to this convent gate?
 How, with empurpled cheeks and pampered eyes,
 Dare they confront the lean austerities
 Of Brethren who, here fixed, on Jesu wait
 In sackcloth, and God's anger deprecate
 Through all that humbles flesh and mortifies?
 Strange contrast! verily the world of dreams,
 Where mingle, as for mockery combined,
 Things in their very essences at strife,
 Shows not a sight incongruous as the extremes
 That everywhere, before the thoughtful mind,
 Meet on the solid ground of waking life.
