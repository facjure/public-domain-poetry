title: In Time Of Sorrow
---

Despair is in the suns that shine,
 And in the rains that fall,
This sad forsaken soul of mine
 Is weary of them all.

They fall and shine on alien streets
 From those I love and know.
I cannot hear amid the heats
 The North Sea's freshening flow

The people hurry up and down,
 Like ghosts that cannot lie;
And wandering through the phantom town
 The weariest ghost am I.
