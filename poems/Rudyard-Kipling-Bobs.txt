 [Field Marshal Lord Roberts of Kandahar]

There's a little red-faced man,
 Which is Bobs,
Rides the talliest 'orse 'e can, 
 Our Bobs.
 If it bucks or kicks or rears,
'E can sit for twenty years
With a smile round both 'is ears, 
 Can't yer, Bobs?

 Then 'ere's to Bobs Bahadur, little Bobs, Bobs, Bobs!
 'E's our pukka Kandaharder, 
 Fightin' Bobs, Bobs, Bobs!
'E's the Dook of Aggy Chel;
'E's the man that done us well,
 An' we'll follow 'im to 'ell, 
 Won't we, Bobs?


 If a limber's slipped a trace,
 'Ook on Bobs.
 If a marker's lost 'is place,
 Dress by Bobs.
For 'e's eyes all up 'is coat,
An'a a bugle in 'is throat,
An'you will not play the goat
 Under Bobs.

'E's a little down on drink
 Chaplain Bobs;
But it keeps us outer Clink, 
 Don't it, Bobs?
So we will not complain
Tho' 'e's water on the brain,
If 'e leads us straight again, 
 Blue-light Bobs.


If you stood 'im on 'is head,
 Father Bobs,
You could spill a quart ot lead
 Outer Bobs.
'E's been at it thirty years,
An-amassin' soveneers
In the way o' slugs an' spears, 
 Ain't yer Bobs?

What 'e does not knowv o'war,
 Gen'ral Bobs,
You cun arst the shop next door, 
 Can't they, Bobs?
Oh, 'e's little but he's wise;
'E's terror for' is size:,
An', 'e, does, not, advertize, 
 Do yer, Bobs?

Now they 've made a blooimin 'Lord
 Ou ter Bobs,
Which was but 'is fair reward, 
 Wheren't it, Bobs?:
So ell wear a coronet
W'here 'is 'elmet used to set;
But we know you won't forget, 
 Will yer, Bobs?


Then 'ere's to Bobs Bahadur, little Bobs, Bobs, Bobs,
Pocket-Wellin'ton 'an arder, 
 Fightin' Bobs, Bobs, Bobs!
This ain't no bloomin' ode,
But you've 'elped the soldier's load,
An' for benefits bestowed,
 Bless yer, Bobs!
