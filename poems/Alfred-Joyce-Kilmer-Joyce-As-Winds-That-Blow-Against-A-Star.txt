title: As Winds That Blow Against A Star

(For Aline)



 Now by what whim of wanton chance
Do radiant eyes know sombre days?
 And feet that shod in light should dance
Walk weary and laborious ways?

 But rays from Heaven, white and whole,
May penetrate the gloom of earth;
 And tears but nourish, in your soul,
The glory of celestial mirth.

 The darts of toil and sorrow, sent
Against your peaceful beauty, are
 As foolish and as impotent
As winds that blow against a star.
