 O for a moon to light me home!
O for a lanthorn green!
 For those sweet stars the Pleiades,
 That glitter in the twilight trees;
O for a lovelorn taper! O
For a lanthorn green!

 O for a frock of tartan!
O for clear, wild, grey eyes!
 For fingers light as violets,
 'Neath branches that the blackbird frets;
O for a thistly meadow! O
For clear, wild grey eyes!

 O for a heart like almond boughs!
O for sweet thoughts like rain!
 O for first-love like fields of grey,
 Shut April-buds at break of day!
O for a sleep like music!
For still dreams like rain!
