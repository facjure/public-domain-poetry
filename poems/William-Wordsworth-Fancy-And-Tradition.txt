author: William Wordsworth 
title: Fancy And Tradition
---

 The Lovers took within this ancient grove
 Their last embrace; beside those crystal springs
 The Hermit saw the Angel spread his wings
 For instant flight; the Sage in yon alcove
 Sate musing; on that hill the Bard would rove,
 Not mute, where now the linnet only sings:
 Thus everywhere to truth Tradition clings,
 Or Fancy localises Powers we love.
 Were only History licensed to take note
 Of things gone by, her meagre monuments
 Would ill suffice for persons and events:
 There is an ampler page for man to quote,
 A readier book of manifold contents,
 Studied alike in palace and in cot.
