Great men have been among us; hands that penn�d
And tongues that utter�d wisdom�better none:
The later Sidney, Marvel, Harrington,
Young Vane, and others who call�d Milton friend.
These moralists could act and comprehend:
They knew how genuine glory was put on;
Taught us how rightfully a nation shone
In splendour: what strength was, that would not bend
But in magnanimous meekness. France, �tis strange,
Hath brought forth no such souls as we had then.
Perpetual emptiness! unceasing change!
No single volume paramount, no code,
No master spirit, no determined road;
But equally a want of books and men!
