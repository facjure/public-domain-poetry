title: Laughing Rose
---

If I were gusty April now,
 How I would blow at laughing Rose;
I'd make her ribbons slip their knots,
 And all her hair come loose.

If I were merry April now,
 How I would pelt her cheeks with showers;
I'd make carnations, rich and warm,
 Of her vermilion flowers.

Since she will laugh in April's face,
 No matter how he rains or blows, 
Then O that I wild April were,
 To play with laughing Rose.
