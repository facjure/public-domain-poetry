title: Epitaphs VII. O Flower Of All That Springs From Gentle Blood
---

 O flower of all that springs from gentle blood,
 And all that generous nurture breeds to make
 Youth amiable; O friend so true of soul
 To fair Aglaia; by what envy moved,
 Lelius! has death cut short thy brilliant day
 In its sweet opening? and what dire mishap
 Has from Savona torn her best delight?
 For thee she mourns, nor e'er will cease to mourn;
 And, should the out-pourings of her eyes suffice not
 For her heart's grief, she will entreat Sebeto
 Not to withhold his bounteous aid, Sebeto
 Who saw thee, on his margin, yield to death,
 In the chaste arms of thy beloved Love!
 What profit riches? what does youth avail?
 Dust are our hopes; I, weeping bitterly,
 Penned these sad lines, nor can forbear to pray
 That every gentle Spirit hither led
 May read them, not without some bitter tears.
