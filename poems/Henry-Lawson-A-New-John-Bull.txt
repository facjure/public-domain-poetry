A tall, slight, English gentleman,
With an eyeglass to his eye;
He mostly says �Good-Bai� to you,
When he means to say �Good-bye�;
He shakes hands like a ladies� man,
For all the world to see, 
But they know, in Corners of the World.
No ladies� man is he.
A tall, slight English gentleman,
Who hates to soil his hands;
He takes his mother�s drawing-room
To the most outlandish lands;
And when, through Hells we dream not of,
His battery prevails,
He cleans the grime of gunpowder
And blue blood from his nails.

He�s what our blokes in Egypt call
�A decent kinder cove.�
And if the Pyramids should fall?
He�d merely say �Bai Jove!�
And if the stones should block his path
For a twelve-month, or a day,
He�d call on Sergeant Whatsisname
To clear those things away!

A quiet English gentleman,
Who dots the Empire�s rim,
Where sweating sons of ebony
Would go to Hell for him.
And if he chances to get �winged,�
Or smashed up rather worse,
He�s quite apologetic to
The doctor and the nurse.

A silent English gentleman, 
Though sometimes he says �Haw.�
But if a baboon in its cage
Appealed to British Law
And Justice, to be understood,
He�d listen all polite,
And do his very best to set
The monkey grievance right.

A thoroughbred whose ancestry
Goes back to ages dim;
Yet no one on his wide estates
Need fear to speak to him.
Although he never showed a sign
Of aught save sympathy,
He was the only gentleman
That shamed the cad in me.
