The first one with conviction penned:
�This conflict in seven weeks will end.�

Another, later in the war,
Gave Germany just one month more.

Since then I�ve read predictions free,
They dribble in unceasingly.

All wrong. And still the critics say
When it will finish to the day.

Hughes should get cash in mighty sacks
From his proposed War Prophets Tax.
