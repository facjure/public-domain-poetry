 All from the light of the sweet moon
 Tired men lie now abed;
 Actionless, full of visions, soon
 Vanishing, soon sped.

 The starry night aflock with beams
 Of crystal light scarce stirs:
 Only its birds - the cocks, the streams,
 Call 'neath heaven's wanderers.

 All silent; all hearts still;
 Love, cunning, fire fallen low:
 When faint morn straying on the hill
 Sighs, and his soft airs flow.
