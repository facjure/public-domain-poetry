To purify their wine, some people bleed
A lamb into the barrel, and succeed;
No nostrum, planters say, is half so good
To make fine sugar as a negro�s blood.
Now lambs and negroes both are harmless things,
And thence perhaps this wondrous virtue springs,
�Tis in the blood of innocence alone�
Good cause why planters never try their own.
