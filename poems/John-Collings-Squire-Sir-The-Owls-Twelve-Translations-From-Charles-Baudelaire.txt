title: The Owls - (Twelve Translations From Charles Baudelaire)

 'Neath their black yews in solemn state
 The owls are sitting in a row
 Like foreign gods; and even so
 Blink their red eyes; they meditate.

 Quite motionless they hold them thus
 Until at last the day is done,
 And driving down the slanting sun,
 The sad night is victorious.

 They teach the wise who gives them ear
 That in this world he most should fear
 All things which loud or restless be.

 Who, dazzled by a passing shade,
 Follows it, never will be free
 Till the dread penalty be paid.
