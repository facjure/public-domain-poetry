title: If Thou Indeed Derive Thy Light From Heaven
---

 If thou indeed derive thy light from Heaven,
 Then, to the measure of that heaven-born light,
 Shine, Poet! in thy place, and be content:
 The stars pre-eminent in magnitude,
 And they that from the zenith dart their beams,
 (Visible though they be to half the earth,
 Though half a sphere be conscious of their brightness)
 Are yet of no diviner origin,
 No purer essence, than the one that burns,
 Like an untended watch-fire on the ridge
 Of some dark mountain; or than those which seem
 Humbly to hang, like twinkling winter lamps,
 Among the branches of the leafless trees.
 All are the undying offspring of one Sire:
 Then, to the measure of the light vouchsafed,
 Shine, Poet! in thy place, and be content.
