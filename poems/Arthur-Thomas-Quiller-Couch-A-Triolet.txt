To commemorate the virtue of Homoeopathy in restoring one apparently drowned.

 Love, that in a tear was drown'd,
 Lives revived by a tear.
 Stella heard them mourn around
 Love that in a tear was drown'd,
 Came and coax'd his dripping swound,
 Wept 'The fault was mine, my dear!'
 Love, that in a tear was drown'd,
 Lives, revived by a tear.
