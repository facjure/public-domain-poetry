 Eden! till now thy beauty had I viewed
 By glimpses only, and confess with shame
 That verse of mine, whate'er its varying mood,
 Repeats but once the sound of thy sweet name:
 Yet fetched from Paradise that honour came,
 Rightfully borne; for Nature gives thee flowers
 That have no rivals among British bowers;
 And thy bold rocks are worthy of their fame.
 Measuring thy course, fair Stream! at length I pay
 To my life's neighbour dues of neighbourhood;
 But I have traced thee on thy winding way
 With pleasure sometimes by this thought restrained
 For things far off we toil, while many a good
 Not sought, because too near, is never gained.
