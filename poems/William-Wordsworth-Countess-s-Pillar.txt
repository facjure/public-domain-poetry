 While the Poor gather round, till the end of time
 May this bright flower of Charity display
 Its bloom, unfolding at the appointed day;
 Flower than the loveliest of the vernal prime
 Lovelier, transplanted from heaven's purest clime!
 "Charity never faileth:" on that creed,
 More than on written testament or deed,
 The pious Lady built with hope sublime.
 Alms on this stone to be dealt out, 'for ever!'
 "Laus Deo." Many a Stranger passing by
 Has with that Parting mixed a filial sigh,
 Blest its humane Memorials fond endeavour;
 And, fastening on those lines an eye tear-glazed,
 Has ended, though no Clerk, with "God be praised!"
