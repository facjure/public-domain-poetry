�Though logic choppers rule the town,
And every man and maid and boy
Has marked a distant object down,
An aimless joy is a pure joy,�
Or so did Tom O�Roughley say
That saw the surges running by,
�And wisdom is a butterfly
And not a gloomy bird of prey.

�If little planned is little sinned
But little need the grave distress.
What�s dying but a second wind?
How but in zigzag wantonness
Could trumpeter Michael be so brave?�
Or something of that sort he said,
�And if my dearest friend were dead
I�d dance a measure on his grave.�
