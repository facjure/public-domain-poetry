 How large unto the tiny fly
Must little things appear! - 
 A rosebud like a feather bed,
Its prickle like a spear;

 A dewdrop like a looking-glass,
A hair like golden wire;
 The smallest grain of mustard-seed
As fierce as coals of fire;

 A loaf of bread, a lofty hill;
A wasp, a cruel leopard;
 And specks of salt as bright to see
As lambkins to a shepherd.
