title: In These Fair Vales Hath Many A Tree
---

 In these fair vales hath many a Tree
 At Wordsworth's suit been spared;
 And from the builder's hand this Stone,
 For some rude beauty of its own,
 Was rescued by the Bard:
 So let it rest; and time will come
 When here the tender-hearted
 May heave a gentle sigh for him,
 As one of the departed.
