 Well sang the Bard who called the grave, in strains
 Thoughtful and sad, the "narrow house." No style
 Of fond sepulchral flattery can beguile
 Grief of her sting; nor cheat, where he detains
 The sleeping dust, stern Death. How reconcile
 With truth, or with each other, decked remains
 Of a once warm Abode, and that 'new' Pile,
 For the departed, built with curious pains
 And mausolean pomp? Yet here they stand
 Together, 'mid trim walks and artful bowers,
 To be looked down upon by ancient hills,
 That, for the living and the dead, demand
 And prompt a harmony of genuine powers;
 Concord that elevates the mind, and stills.
