Frowned the Laird on the Lord: �So, red-handed I catch thee?
Death-doomed by our Law of the Border!
We�ve a gallows outside and a chiel to dispatch thee:
Who trespasses, hangs: all�s in order.�

He met frown with smile, did the young English gallant:
Then the Laird�s dame: �Nay, Husband, I beg!
He�s comely: be merciful! Grace for the callant
If he marries our Muckle-mouth Meg!

�No mile-wide-mouthed monster of yours do I marry:
Grant rather the gallows!� laughed he.
�Foul fare kith and kin of you, why do you tarry?�
�To tame your fierce temper!� quoth she.

�Shove him quick in the Hole, shut him fast for a week:
Cold, darkness, and hunger work wonders:
Who lion-like roars now, mouse-fashion will squeak,
And �it rains� soon succeed to �it thunders.��

A week did he bide in the cold and the dark
Not hunger: for duly at morning
In flitted a lass, and a voice like a lark
Chirped, �Muckle-mouth Meg still ye�re scorning?

�Go hang, but here�s parritch to hearten ye first!�
�Did Meg�s muckle-mouth boast within some
Such music as yours, mine should match it or burst:
No frog-jaws! So tell folk, my Winsome!�

Soon week came to end, and, from Hole�s door set wide,
Out he marched, and there waited the lassie:
�Yon gallows, or Muckle-mouth Meg for bride!
Consider! Sky�s blue and turf�s grassy:

�Life�s sweet: shall I say ye wed Muckle-mouth Meg?�
�Not I,� quoth the stout heart: �too eerie
The mouth that can swallow a bubblyjock�s egg;
Shall I let it munch mine? Never, Dearie!

�Not Muckle-mouth Meg? Wow, the obstinate man!
Perhaps he would rather wed me!�
�Ay, would he, with just for a dowry your can!�
�I�m Muckle-mouth Meg,� chirruped she.

�Then so-so-so-so,� as he kissed her apace,
�Will I widen thee out till thou turnest
From Margaret Minnikin-mou�, by God�s grace,
To Muckle-mouth Meg in good earnest!�
