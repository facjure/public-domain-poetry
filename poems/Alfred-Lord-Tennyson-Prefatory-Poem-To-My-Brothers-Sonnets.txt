Midnight June 30 1879

I.

Midnight�in no midsummer tune
The breakers lash the shores:
The cuckoo of a joyless June
Is calling out of doors:

And thou hast vanish�d from thine own
To that which looks like rest,
True brother, only to be known
By those who love thee best.


II.

Midnight�and joyless June gone by,
And from the deluged park
The cuckoo of a worse July
Is calling thro� the dark:

But thou art silent underground,
And o�er thee streams the rain,
True poet, surely to be found
When Truth is found again.


III.

And now, in these unsummer�d skies
The summer bird is still,
Far off a phantom cuckoo cries
From out a phantom hill;

And thro� this midnight breaks the sun
Of sixty years away,
The light of days when life begun,
The days that seem to-day,

When all my griefs were shared with thee,
As all my hopes were thine�
As all thou wert was one with me,
May all thou art be mine!
