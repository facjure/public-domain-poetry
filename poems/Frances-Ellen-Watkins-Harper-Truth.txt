 A rock, for ages, stern and high,
 Stood frowning 'gainst the earth and sky,
 And never bowed his haughty crest
 When angry storms around him prest.
 Morn, springing from the arms of night,
 Had often bathed his brow with light.
 And kissed the shadows from his face
 With tender love and gentle grace.

 Day, pausing at the gates of rest,
 Smiled on him from the distant West,
 And from her throne the dark-browed Night
 Threw round his path her softest light.
 And yet he stood unmoved and proud,
 Nor love, nor wrath, his spirit bowed;
 He bared his brow to every blast
 And scorned the tempest as it passed.

 One day a tiny, humble seed -
 The keenest eye would hardly heed -
 Fell trembling at that stern rock's base,
 And found a lowly hiding-place.
 A ray of light, and drop of dew,
 Came with a message, kind and true;
 They told her of the world so bright,
 Its love, its joy, and rosy light,
 And lured her from her hiding-place,
 To gaze upon earth's glorious face.

 So, peeping timid from the ground,
 She clasped the ancient rock around,
 And climbing up with childish grace,
 She held him with a close embrace;


 Her clinging was a thing of dread;
 Where'er she touched a fissure spread,
 And he who'd breasted many a storm
 Stood frowning there, a mangled form;
 A Truth, dropped in the silent earth,
 May seem a thing of little worth,
 Till, spreading round some mighty wrong,
 It saps its pillars proud and strong,
 And o'er the fallen ruin weaves
 The brightest blooms and fairest leaves.
