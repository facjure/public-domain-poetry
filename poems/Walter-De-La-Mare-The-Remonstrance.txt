 I was at peace until you came
 And set a careless mind aflame.
 I lived in quiet; cold, content;
 All longing in safe banishment,
 Until your ghostly lips and eyes
 Made wisdom unwise.

 Naught was in me to tempt your feet
 To seek a lodging. Quite forgot
 Lay the sweet solitude we two
 In childhood used to wander through;
 Time's cold had closed my heart about;
 And shut you out.

 Well, and what then?... O vision grave,
 Take all the little all I have!
 Strip me of what in voiceless thought
 Life's kept of life, unhoped, unsought! - 
 Reverie and dream that memory must
 Hide deep in dust!

 This only I say: - Though cold and bare
 The haunted house you have chosen to share,
 Still 'neath its walls the moonbeam goes
 And trembles on the untended rose;

 Still o'er its broken roof-tree rise
 The starry arches of the skies;
 And in your lightest word shall be
 The thunder of an ebbing sea.
