title: Now Finale To The Shore

Now finale to the shore!
Now, land and life, finale, and farewell!
Now Voyager depart! (much, much for thee is yet in store;)
Often enough hast thou adventur'd o'er the seas,
Cautiously cruising, studying the charts,
Duly again to port, and hawser's tie, returning:
But now obey, thy cherish'd, secret wish,
Embrace thy friends - leave all in order;
To port, and hawser's tie, no more returning,
Depart upon thy endless cruise, old Sailor!
