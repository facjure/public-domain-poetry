 How beautiful your presence, how benign,
 Servants of God! who not a thought will share
 With the vain world; who, outwardly as bare
 As winter trees, yield no fallacious sign
 That the firm soul is clothed with fruit divine!
 Such Priest, when service worthy of his care
 Has called him forth to breathe the common air,
 Might seem a saintly Image from its shrine
 Descended: happy are the eyes that meet
 The Apparition; evil thoughts are stayed
 At his approach, and low-bowed necks entreat
 A benediction from his voice or hand;
 Whence grace, through which the heart can understand,
 And vows, that bind the will, in silence made.
