 No rose that in a garden ever grew,
 In Homer's or in Omar's or in mine,
 Though buried under centuries of fine
 Dead dust of roses, shut from sun and dew
 Forever, and forever lost from view,
 But must again in fragrance rich as wine
 The grey aisles of the air incarnadine
 When the old summers surge into a new.
 Thus when I swear, "I love with all my heart,"
 'Tis with the heart of Lilith that I swear,
 'Tis with the love of Lesbia and Lucrece;
 And thus as well my love must lose some part
 Of what it is, had Helen been less fair,
 Or perished young, or stayed at home in Greece.
