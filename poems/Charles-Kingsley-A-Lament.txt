title: A Lament
---

The merry merry lark was up and singing,
 And the hare was out and feeding on the lea;
And the merry merry bells below were ringing,
 When my child's laugh rang through me.

Now the hare is snared and dead beside the snow-yard,
 And the lark beside the dreary winter sea;
And the baby in his cradle in the churchyard
 Sleeps sound till the bell brings me.

Eversley, 1848.
