[1]

 A braggart, lover of the chase,
 Had lost a dog of valued race,
 And thought him in a lion's maw.
 He ask'd a shepherd whom he saw,
 'Pray show me, man, the robber's place,
 And I'll have justice in the case.'
 ''Tis on this mountain side,'
 The shepherd man replied.
 'The tribute of a sheep I pay,
 Each month, and where I please I stray.'
 Out leap'd the lion as he spake,
 And came that way, with agile feet.
 The braggart, prompt his flight to take,
 Cried, 'Jove, O grant a safe retreat!'

 A danger close at hand
 Of courage is the test.
 It shows us who will stand - 
 Whose legs will run their best.
