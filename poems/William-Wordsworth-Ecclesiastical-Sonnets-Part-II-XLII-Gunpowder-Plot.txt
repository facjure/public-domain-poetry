 Fear hath a hundred eyes that all agree
 To plague her beating heart; and there is one
 (Nor idlest that!) which holds communion
 With things that were not, yet were 'meant' to be.
 Aghast within its gloomy cavity
 That eye (which sees as if fulfilled and done
 Crimes that might stop the motion of the sun)
 Beholds the horrible catastrophe
 Of an assembled Senate unredeemed
 From subterraneous Treason's darkling power:
 Merciless act of sorrow infinite!
 Worse than the product of that dismal night,
 When gushing, copious as a thunder-shower,
 The blood of Huguenots through Paris streamed.
