 The Baptist might have been ordained to cry
 Forth from the towers of that huge Pile, wherein
 His Father served Jehovah; but how win
 Due audience, how for aught but scorn defy
 The obstinate pride and wanton revelry
 Of the Jerusalem below, her sin
 And folly, if they with united din
 Drown not at once mandate and prophecy?
 Therefore the Voice spake from the Desert, thence
 To Her, as to her opposite in peace,
 Silence, and holiness, and innocence,
 To Her and to all Lands its warning sent,
 Crying with earnestness that might not cease,
 "Make straight a highway for the Lord repent!"
