title: Winter In Durnover Field
---

SCENE. - A wide stretch of fallow ground recently sown with wheat, and frozen to iron hardness. Three large birds walking about thereon, and wistfully eyeing the surface. Wind keen from north-east: sky a dull grey.

(TRIOLET)

Rook. - Throughout the field I find no grain;
 The cruel frost encrusts the cornland!
Starling. - Aye: patient pecking now is vain
 Throughout the field, I find . . .
Rook. - No grain!
Pigeon. - Nor will be, comrade, till it rain,
 Or genial thawings loose the lorn land
 Throughout the field.
Rook. - I find no grain:
 The cruel frost encrusts the cornland!
