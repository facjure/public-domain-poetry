 The star which comes at close of day to shine
 More heavenly bright than when it leads the morn,
 Is friendship's emblem, whether the forlorn
 She visiteth, or, shedding light benign
 Through shades that solemnize Life's calm decline,
 Doth make the happy happier. This have we
 Learnt, Isabel, from thy society,
 Which now we too unwillingly resign
 Though for brief absence. But farewell! the page
 Glimmers before my sight through thankful tears,
 Such as start forth, not seldom, to approve
 Our truth, when we, old yet unchilled by age,
 Call thee, though known but for a few fleet years,
 The heart-affianced sister of our love!
