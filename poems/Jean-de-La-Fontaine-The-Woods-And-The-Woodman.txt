title: The Woods And The Woodman.
---

 A certain wood-chopper lost or broke
 From his axe's eye a bit of oak.
 The forest must needs be somewhat spared
 While such a loss was being repair'd.
 Came the man at last, and humbly pray'd
 That the woods would kindly lend to him - 
 A moderate loan - a single limb,
 Whereof might another helve be made,
 And his axe should elsewhere drive its trade.
 O, the oaks and firs that then might stand,
 A pride and a joy throughout the land,
 For their ancientness and glorious charms!
 The innocent Forest lent him arms;
 But bitter indeed was her regret;
 For the wretch, his axe new-helved and whet,
 Did nought but his benefactress spoil
 Of the finest trees that graced her soil;
 And ceaselessly was she made to groan,
 Doing penance for that fatal loan.

 Behold the world-stage and its actors,
 Where benefits hurt benefactors! - 
 A weary theme, and full of pain;
 For where's the shade so cool and sweet,
 Protecting strangers from the heat,
 But might of such a wrong complain?
 Alas! I vex myself in vain;
 Ingratitude, do what I will,
 Is sure to be the fashion still.
