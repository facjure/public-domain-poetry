While I, from that reed-throated whisperer
Who comes at need, although not now as once
A clear articulation in the air
But inwardly, surmise companions
Beyond the fling of the dull ass�s hoof,
Ben Jonson�s phrase, and find when June is come
At Kyle-na-no under that ancient roof
A sterner conscience and a friendlier home,
I can forgive even that wrong of wrongs,
Those undreamt accidents that have made me
Seeing that Fame has perished this long while
Being but a part of ancient ceremony,
Notorious, till all my priceless things
Are but a post the passing dogs defile.
