title: Picture Of Daniel In The Lions' Den, At Hamilton Palace
---

 Amid a fertile region green with wood
 And fresh with rivers, well did it become
 The ducal Owner, in his palace-home
 To naturalise this tawny Lion brood;
 Children of Art, that claim strange brotherhood
 (Couched in their den) with those that roam at large
 Over the burning wilderness, and charge
 The wind with terror while they roar for food.
 Satiate are 'these'; and stilled to eye and ear;
 Hence, while we gaze, a more enduring fear!
 Yet is the Prophet calm, nor would the cave
 Daunt him, if his Companions, now bedrowsed
 Outstretched and listless, were by hunger roused:
 Man placed him here, and God, he knows, can save.
