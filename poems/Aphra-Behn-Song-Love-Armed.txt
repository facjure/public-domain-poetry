title: Song : 'Love Armed'
---

Love in fantastic triumph sate
Whilst bleeding hearts around him flow�d,
For whom fresh pains he did create
And strange tyrannic power he show�d:
From thy bright eyes he took his fires,
Which round about in sport he hurl�d;
But �twas from mine he took desires
Enough t� undo the amorous world.

From me he took his sighs and tears,
From thee his pride and cruelty;
From me his languishments and fears,
And every killing dart from thee.
Thus thou and I the god have arm�d
And set him up a deity;
But my poor heart alone is harm�d,
Whilst thine the victor is, and free!
