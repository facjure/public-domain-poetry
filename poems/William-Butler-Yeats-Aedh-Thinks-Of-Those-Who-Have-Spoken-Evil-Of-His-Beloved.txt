title: Aedh Thinks Of Those Who Have Spoken Evil Of His Beloved
---

Half close your eyelids, loosen your hair,
And dream about the great and their pride;
They have spoken against you everywhere,
But weigh this song with the great and their pride;
I made it out of a mouthful of air,
Their children�s children shall say they have lied.
