Wide solemn eyes that question me,
Wee hand that pats my head,
Where only two have stroked before,
And both of them are dead.
�Ah, poo-ah Daddy mine,� she says,
With wondrous sympathy,
Oh, baby girl, you don�t know how
You break the heart in me!
Let friends and kinsfolk work their worst,
And the world say what it will,
Your baby arms go round my neck,
I�m your own Daddy still!
And you kiss me and I kiss you,
Fresh kisses frank and free,
Ah, baby girl, you don�t know how
You break the heart in me!

I dreamed when I was good that when
The snow showed in my hair,
A household angel in her teens
Would flit about my chair,
To comfort me as I grew old;
But that shall never be,
Ah, baby girl, you don�t know how
You break the heart in me!

But one shall love me while I live
And soothe my troubled head,
And never hear an unkind word
Of me when I am dead.
Her eyes shall light to hear my name
Howe�er disgraced it be,
Ah, baby girl, you don�t know how
You help the heart in me!
