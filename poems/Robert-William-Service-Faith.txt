 Since all that is was ever bound to be;
 Since grim, eternal laws our Being bind;
 And both the riddle and the answer find,
 And both the carnage and the calm decree;
 Since plain within the Book of Destiny
 Is written all the journey of mankind
 Inexorably to the end; since blind
 And mortal puppets playing parts are we:

 Then let's have faith; good cometh out of ill;
 The power that shaped the strife shall end the strife;
 Then let's bow down before the Unknown Will;
 Fight on, believing all is well with life;
 Seeing within the worst of War's red rage
 The gleam, the glory of the Golden Age.
