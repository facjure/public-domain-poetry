title: To The Author's Portrait

 Go, faithful Portrait! and where long hath knelt
 Margaret, the Saintly Foundress, take thy place;
 And, if Time spare the colours for the grace
 Which to the work surpassing skill hath dealt,
 Thou, on thy rock reclined, though kingdoms melt
 And states be torn up by the roots, wilt seem
 To breathe in rural peace, to hear the stream,
 And think and feel as once the Poet felt.
 Whate'er thy fate, those features have not grown
 Unrecognised through many a household tear
 More prompt, more glad, to fall than drops of dew
 By morning shed around a flower half-blown;
 Tears of delight, that testified how true
 To life thou art, and, in thy truth, how dear!
