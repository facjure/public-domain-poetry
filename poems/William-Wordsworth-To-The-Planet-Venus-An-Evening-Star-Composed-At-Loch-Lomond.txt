title: To The Planet Venus, An Evening Star - Composed At Loch Lomond
---

 Though joy attend Thee orient at the birth
 Of dawn, it cheers the lofty spirit most
 To watch thy course when Day-light, fled from earth,
 In the grey sky hath left his lingering Ghost,
 Perplexed as if between a splendour lost
 And splendour slowly mustering. Since the Sun,
 The absolute, the world-absorbing One,
 Relinquished half his empire to the host
 Emboldened by thy guidance, holy Star,
 Holy as princely, who that looks on thee,
 Touching, as now, in thy humility
 The mountain borders of this seat of care,
 Can question that thy countenance is bright,
 Celestial Power, as much with love as light?
