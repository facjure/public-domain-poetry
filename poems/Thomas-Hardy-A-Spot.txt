title: A Spot

 In years defaced and lost,
 Two sat here, transport-tossed,
 Lit by a living love
The wilted world knew nothing of:
 Scared momently
 By gaingivings,
 Then hoping things
 That could not be.

 Of love and us no trace
 Abides upon the place;
 The sun and shadows wheel,
Season and season sereward steal;
 Foul days and fair
 Here, too, prevail,
 And gust and gale
 As everywhere.

 But lonely shepherd souls
 Who bask amid these knolls
 May catch a faery sound
On sleepy noontides from the ground:
 "O not again
 Till Earth outwears
 Shall love like theirs
 Suffuse this glen!"
