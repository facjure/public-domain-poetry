 Dishonoured Rock and Ruin! that, by law
 Tyrannic, keep the Bird of Jove embarred
 Like a lone criminal whose life is spared.
 Vexed is he, and screams loud. The last I saw
 Was on the wing; stooping, he struck with awe
 Man, bird, and beast; then, with a consort paired,
 From a bold headland, their loved aery's guard,
 Flew high above Atlantic waves, to draw
 Light from the fountain of the setting sun.
 Such was this Prisoner once; and, when his plumes
 The sea-blast ruffles as the storm comes on,
 Then, for a moment, he, in spirit, resumes
 His rank 'mong freeborn creatures that live free,
 His power, his beauty, and his majesty.
