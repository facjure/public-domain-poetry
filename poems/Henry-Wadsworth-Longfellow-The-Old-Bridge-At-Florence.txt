title: The Old Bridge At Florence
---

Taddeo Gaddi built me.I am old,
Five centuries old.I plant my foot of stone
Upon the Arno, as St. Michael's own
Was planted on the dragon.Fold by fold
Beneath me as it struggles.I behold
Its glistening scales.Twice hath it overthrown
My kindred and companions.Me alone
It moveth not, but is by me controlled,
I can remember when the Medici
Were driven from Florence; longer still ago
The final wars of Ghibelline and Guelf.
Florence adorns me with her jewelry;
And when I think that Michael Angelo
Hath leaned on me, I glory in myself.
