I

 "O Lord, why grievest Thou? -
 Since Life has ceased to be
 Upon this globe, now cold
 As lunar land and sea,
And humankind, and fowl, and fur
 Are gone eternally,
All is the same to Thee as ere
 They knew mortality."

II

"O Time," replied the Lord,
 "Thou read'st me ill, I ween;
Were all THE SAME, I should not grieve
 At that late earthly scene,
Now blestly past - though planned by me
 With interest close and keen! -
Nay, nay: things now are NOT the same
 As they have earlier been.

III

 "Written indelibly
 On my eternal mind
 Are all the wrongs endured
 By Earth's poor patient kind,
Which my too oft unconscious hand
 Let enter undesigned.
No god can cancel deeds foredone,
 Or thy old coils unwind!

IV

 "As when, in Noe's days,
 I whelmed the plains with sea,
 So at this last, when flesh
 And herb but fossils be,
And, all extinct, their piteous dust
 Revolves obliviously,
That I made Earth, and life, and man,
 It still repenteth me!"
