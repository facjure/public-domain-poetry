 The sun is clear of bird and cloud,
 The grass shines windless, grey, and still,
 In dusky ruin the owl dreams on,
 The cuckoo echoes on the hill;
Yet soft along Alulvan's walks
 The ghost at noonday stalks.

 His eyes in shadow of his hat
 Stare on the ruins of his house;
 His cloak, up-fasten'd with a brooch,
 Of faded velvet grey as mouse,
Brushes the roses as he goes:
 Yet wavers not one rose.

 The wild birds in a cloud fly up
 From their sweet feeding in the fruit;
 The droning of the bees and flies
 Rises gradual as a lute;
Is it for fear the birds are flown,
 And shrills the insect-drone?

 Thick is the ivy o'er Alulvan,
 And crisp with summer-heat its turf;
 Far, far across its empty pastures
 Alulvan's sands are white with surf:
And he himself is grey as sea,
 Watching beneath an elder-tree.

 All night the fretful, shrill Banshee
 Lurks in the chambers' dark festoons,
 Calling for ever, o'er garden and river,
 Through magpie changing of the moons:
'Alulvan, O, alas! Alulvan,
 The doom of lone Alulvan!'
