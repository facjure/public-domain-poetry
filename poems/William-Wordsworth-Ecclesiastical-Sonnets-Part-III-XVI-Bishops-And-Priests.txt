 Bishops and Priests, blessed are ye, if deep
 (As yours above all offices is high)
 Deep in your hearts the sense of duty lie;
 Charged as ye are by Christ to feed and keep
 From wolves your portion of his chosen sheep:
 Labouring as ever in your Master's sight,
 Making your hardest task your best delight,
 What perfect glory ye in Heaven shall reap!
 But, in the solemn Office which ye sought
 And undertook premonished, if unsound
 Your practice prove, faithless though but in thought,
 Bishops and Priests, think what a gulf profound
 Awaits yon then, if they were rightly taught
 Who framed the Ordinance by your lives disowned!
