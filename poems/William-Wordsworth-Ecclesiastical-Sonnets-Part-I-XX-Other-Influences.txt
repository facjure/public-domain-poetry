 Ah, when the Body, round which in love we clung,
 Is chilled by death, does mutual service fail?
 Is tender pity then of no avail?
 Are intercessions of the fervent tongue
 A waste of hope? From this sad source have sprung
 Rites that console the Spirit, under grief
 Which ill can brook more rational relief:
 Hence, prayers are shaped amiss, and dirges sung
 For Souls whose doom is fixed! The way is smooth
 For Power that travels with the human heart:
 Confession ministers the pang to soothe
 In him who at the ghost of guilt doth start.
 Ye holy Men, so earnest in your care,
 Of your own mighty instruments beware!
