title: Ecclesiastical Sonnets - Part I. - XXXIX - Papal Dominion
---

 Unless to Peter's Chair the viewless wind
 Must come and ask permission when to blow,
 What further empire would it have? for now
 A ghostly Domination, unconfined
 As that by dreaming Bards to Love assigned,
 Sits there in sober truth, to raise the low,
 Perplex the wise, the strong to overthrow;
 Through earth and heaven to bind and to unbind!
 Resist the thunder quails thee! crouch rebuff
 Shall be thy recompense! from land to land
 The ancient thrones of Christendom are stuff
 For occupation of a magic wand,
 And 'tis the Pope that wields it: whether rough
 Or smooth his front, our world is in his hand!
