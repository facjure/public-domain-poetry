title: Strings In The Earth And Air
---

Strings in the earth and air
Make music sweet;
Strings by the river where
The willows meet.

There�s music along the river
For Love wanders there,
Pale flowers on his mantle,
Dark leaves on his hair.

All softly playing,
With head to the music bent,
And fingers straying
Upon an instrument.
