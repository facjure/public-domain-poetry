 Cherish you then the hope I shall forget
 At length, my lord, Pieria?--put away
 For your so passing sake, this mouth of clay
 These mortal bones against my body set,
 For all the puny fever and frail sweat
 Of human love,--renounce for these, I say,
 The Singing Mountain's memory, and betray
 The silent lyre that hangs upon me yet?
 Ah, but indeed, some day shall you awake,
 Rather, from dreams of me, that at your side
 So many nights, a lover and a bride,
 But stern in my soul's chastity, have lain,
 To walk the world forever for my sake,
 And in each chamber find me gone again!
