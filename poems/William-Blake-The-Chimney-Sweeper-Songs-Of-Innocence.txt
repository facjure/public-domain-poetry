---

When my mother died I was very young,
And my father sold me while yet my tongue,
Could scarcely cry weep weep weep weep,
So your chimneys I sweep &amp; in soot I sleep.

Theres little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head
That curled like a lambs back was shav�d, so I said.
Hush Tom never mind it, for when your head�s bare,
You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair

And so he was quiet. &amp; that very night.
As Tom was a sleeping he had such a sight
That thousands of sweepers Dick, Joe, Ned, &amp; Jack
Were all of them lock�d up in coffins of black,

And by came an Angel who had a bright key
And he open�d the coffins &amp; set them all free.
Then down a green plain leaping laughing they run
And wash in a river and shine in the Sun.

Then naked &amp; white, all their bags left behind.
They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind.
And the Angel told Tom, if he�d be a good boy,
He�d have God for his father &amp; never want joy.

And so Tom awoke and we rose in the dark
And got with our bags &amp; our brushes to work.
Tho� the morning was cold, Tom was happy &amp; warm
So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.
