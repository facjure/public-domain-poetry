title: The Maiden's Lament.
---

 The clouds fast gather,
The forest-oaks roar 
 A maiden is sitting
Beside the green shore, 
The billows are breaking with might, with might,
And she sighs aloud in the darkling night,
Her eyelid heavy with weeping.

 "My heart's dead within me,
The world is a void;
 To the wish it gives nothing,
Each hope is destroyed.
I have tasted the fulness of bliss below
I have lived, I have loved, Thy child, oh take now,
Thou Holy One, into Thy keeping!"

 "In vain is thy sorrow,
In vain thy tears fall,
 For the dead from their slumbers
They ne'er can recall;
Yet if aught can pour comfort and balm in thy heart,
Now that love its sweet pleasures no more can impart,
Speak thy wish, and thou granted shalt find it!"

 "Though in vain is my sorrow,
Though in vain my tears fall, 
 Though the dead from their slumbers
They ne'er can recall,
Yet no balm is so sweet to the desolate heart,
When love its soft pleasures no more can impart,
As the torments that love leaves behind it!"
