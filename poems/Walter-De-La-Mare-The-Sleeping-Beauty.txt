 The scent of bramble sweets the air,
Amid her folded sheets she lies,
 The gold of evening in her hair,
The blue of morn shut in her eyes.

 How many a changing moon hath lit
The unchanging roses of her face!
 Her mirror ever broods on it
In silver stillness of the days.

 Oft flits the moth on filmy wings
Into his solitary lair;
 Shrill evensong the cricket sings
From some still shadow in her hair.

 In heat, in snow, in wind, in flood,
She sleeps in lovely loneliness,
 Half folded like an April bud
On winter-haunted trees.
