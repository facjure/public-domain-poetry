 Shadow and light both strove to be
 The eight bell-ringers' company,
 As with his gliding rope in hand,
 Counting his changes, each did stand;
 While rang and trembled every stone,
 To music by the bell-mouths blown,
 Till the bright clouds that towered on high
 Seemed to re-echo cry with cry.
 Still swang the clappers to and fro,
 When, in the far-spread fields below,
 I saw a ploughman with his team
 Lift to the bells and fix on them
 His distant eyes, as if he would
 Drink in the utmost sound he could;
 While near him sat his children three,
 And in the green grass placidly
 Played undistracted on, as if
 What music earthly bells might give
 Could only faintly stir their dream,
 And stillness make more lovely seem.
 Soon night hid horses, children, all
 In sleep deep and ambrosial;
 Yet, yet it seemed from star to star,
 Welling now near, now faint and far,
 Those echoing bells rang on in dream,
 And stillness made even lovelier seem.
