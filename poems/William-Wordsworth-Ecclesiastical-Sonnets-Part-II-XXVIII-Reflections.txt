 Grant, that by this unsparing hurricane
 Green leaves with yellow mixed are torn away,
 And goodly fruitage with the mother spray;
 'Twere madness, wished we, therefore, to detain,
 With hands stretched forth in mollified disdain,
 The "trumpery" that ascends in bare display
 Bulls, pardons, relics, cowls black, white, and grey
 Upwhirled, and flying o'er the ethereal plain
 Fast bound for Limbo Lake. And yet not choice
 But habit rules the unreflecting herd,
 And airy bonds are hardest to disown;
 Hence, with the spiritual sovereignty transferred
 Unto itself, the Crown assumes a voice
 Of reckless mastery, hitherto unknown.
