title: Sonnets Upon The Punishment Of Death - In Series, 1839 � IV - Is 'Death', When Evil Against Good Has Fought
---

 Is 'Death', when evil against good has fought
 With such fell mastery that a man may dare
 By deeds the blackest purpose to lay bare?
 Is Death, for one to that condition brought,
 For him, or any one, the thing that ought
 To be 'most' dreaded? Lawgivers, beware,
 Lest, capital pains remitting till ye spare
 The murderer, ye, by sanction to that thought
 Seemingly given, debase the general mind;
 Tempt the vague will tried standards to disown,
 Nor only palpable restraints unbind,
 But upon Honour's head disturb the crown,
 Whose absolute rule permits not to withstand
 In the weak love of life his least command.
