Naked and grey the Cotswolds stand
 Beneath the autumn sun,
And the stubble-fields on either hand
 Where Stour and Avon run.
There is no change in the patient land
 That has bred us every one.
 
She should have passed in cloud and fire
 And saved us from this sin
Of war, red war,' twixt child and sire,
 Household and kith and kin,
In the heart of a sleepy Midland shire.
 With the harvest scarcely in.

But there is no change as we meet at last
 On the brow-head or the plain,
And the raw astonished ranks stand fast
 To slay or to be slain
By the men they knew in the kindly past
 That shall never come again,

By the men they met at dance or chase,
 In the tavern or the hall,
At the j ustice-bench and the market-place,
 At the cudgel-play or brawl,
Of their own blood and speech and race,
 Comrades or neighbours all!

More bitter than death this day must prove
 Whichever way it go,
For the brothers of the maids we love
 Make ready to lay low
Their sisters sweethearts, as we move
 Against our dearest foe.

Thank Heaven! At last the trumpets peal
 Before our strength gives way.
For King or for the Commonweal,
 No matter which they say,
The first dry rattle of new-drawn steel
 Changes the world to-day!
