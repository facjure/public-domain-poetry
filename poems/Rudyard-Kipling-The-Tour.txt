Thirteen as twelve my Murray always took,
He was a publisher. The new Police
Have neater ways of bringing men to book,
So Juan found himself before J.P.'s
Accused of stormingthrough that placed nook
At practically any pace you please.
The Dogberry, and the Waterbury, made
It fifty mile, five pounds. And Juan paid!
