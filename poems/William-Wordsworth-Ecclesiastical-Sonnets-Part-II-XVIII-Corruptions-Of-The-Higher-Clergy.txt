 "Woe to you, Prelates! rioting in ease
 "And cumbrous wealth the shame of your estate;
 "You, on whose progress dazzling trains await
 "Of pompous horses; whom vain titles please;
 "Who will be served by others on their knees,
 "Yet will yourselves to God no service pay;
 "Pastors who neither take nor point the way
 "To Heaven; for, either lost in vanities
 "Ye have no skill to teach, or if ye know
 "And speak the word" Alas! of fearful things
 'Tis the most fearful when the people's eye
 Abuse hath cleared from vain imaginings;
 And taught the general voice to prophesy
 Of Justice armed, and Pride to be laid low.
