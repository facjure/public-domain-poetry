 "Flowers, only flowers - bring me dainty posies,
 Blossoms for forgetfulness," that was all he said;
 So we sacked our gardens, violets and roses,
 Lilies white and bluebells laid we on his bed.
 Soft his pale hands touched them, tenderly caressing;
 Soft into his tired eyes came a little light;
 Such a wistful love-look, gentle as a blessing;
 There amid the flowers waited he the night.

 "I would have you raise me; I can see the West then:
 I would see the sun set once before I go."
 So he lay a-gazing, seemed to be at rest then,
 Quiet as a spirit in the golden glow.
 So he lay a-watching rosy castles crumbling,
 Moats of blinding amber, bastions of flame,
 Rugged rifts of opal, crimson turrets tumbling;
 So he lay a-dreaming till the shadows came.

 "Open wide the window; there's a lark a-singing;
 There's a glad lark singing in the evening sky.
 How it's wild with rapture, radiantly winging:
 Oh it's good to hear that when one has to die.
 I am horror-haunted from the hell they found me;
 I am battle-broken, all I want is rest.
 Ah! It's good to die so, blossoms all around me,
 And a kind lark singing in the golden West.

 "Flowers, song and sunshine, just one thing is wanting,
 Just the happy laughter of a little child."
 So we brought our dearest, Doris all-enchanting;
 Tenderly he kissed her; radiant he smiled.
 "In the golden peace-time you will tell the story
 How for you and yours, sweet, bitter deaths were ours. . . .
 God bless little children!" So he passed to glory,
 So we left him sleeping, still amid the flow'rs.
