title: Epitaphs V. True Is It That Ambrosio Salinero
---

 True is it that Ambrosio Salinero
 With an untoward fate was long involved
 In odious litigation; and full long,
 Fate harder still! had he to endure assaults
 Of racking malady. And true it is
 That not the less a frank courageous heart
 And buoyant spirit triumphed over pain;
 And he was strong to follow in the steps
 Of the fair Muses. Not a covert path
 Leads to the dear Parnassian forest's shade,
 That might from him be hidden; not a track
 Mounts to pellucid Hippocrene, but he
 Had traced its windings. This Savona knows,
 Yet no sepulchral honours to her Son
 She paid, for in our age the heart is ruled
 Only by gold. And now a simple stone
 Inscribed with this memorial here is raised
 By his bereft, his lonely, Chiabrera.
 Think not, O Passenger! who read'st the lines,
 That an exceeding love hath dazzled me;
 No, he was One whose memory ought to spread
 Where'er Permessus bears an honoured name,
 And live as long as its pure stream shall flow.
