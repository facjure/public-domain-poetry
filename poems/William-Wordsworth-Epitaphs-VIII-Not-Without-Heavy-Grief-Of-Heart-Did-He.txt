title: Epitaphs VIII. Not Without Heavy Grief Of Heart Did He
---

 Not without heavy grief of heart did He
 On whom the duty fell (for at that time
 The father sojourned in a distant land)
 Deposit in the hollow of this tomb
 A brother's Child, most tenderly beloved!
 FRANCESCO was the name the Youth had borne,
 POZZOBONNELLI his illustrious house;
 And, when beneath this stone the Corse was laid,
 The eyes of all Savona streamed with tears.
 Alas! the twentieth April of his life
 Had scarcely flowered: and at this early time,
 By genuine virtue he inspired a hope
 That greatly cheered his country: to his kin
 He promised comfort; and the flattering thoughts
 His friends had in their fondness entertained,
 He suffered not to languish or decay.
 Now is there not good reason to break forth
 Into a passionate lament? O Soul!
 Short while a Pilgrim in our nether world,
 Do thou enjoy the calm empyreal air;
 And round this earthly tomb let roses rise,
 An everlasting spring! in memory
 Of that delightful fragrance which was once
 From thy mild manners quietly exhaled.
