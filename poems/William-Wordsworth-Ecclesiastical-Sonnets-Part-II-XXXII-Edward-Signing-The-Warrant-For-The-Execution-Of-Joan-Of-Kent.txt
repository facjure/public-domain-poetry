 The tears of man in various measure gush
 From various sources; gently overflow
 From blissful transport some, from clefts of woe
 Some with ungovernable impulse rush;
 And some, coeval with the earliest blush
 Of infant passion, scarcely dare to show
 Their pearly lustre, coming but to go;
 And some break forth when others' sorrows crush
 The sympathising heart. Nor these, nor yet
 The noblest drops to admiration known,
 To gratitude, to injuries forgiven
 Claim Heaven's regard like waters that have wet
 The innocent eyes of youthful Monarchs driven
 To pen the mandates, nature doth disown.
