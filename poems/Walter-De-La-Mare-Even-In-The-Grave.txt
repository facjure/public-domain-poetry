title: Even In The Grave

 I laid my inventory at the hand
Of Death, who in his gloomy arbour sate;
And while he conned it, sweet and desolate
 I heard Love singing in that quiet land.
 He read the record even to the end - 
The heedless, livelong injuries of Fate,
The burden of foe, the burden of love and hate;
 The wounds of foe, the bitter wounds of friend:

 All, all, he read, ay, even the indifference,
The vain talk, vainer silence, hope and dream.
 He questioned me: "What seek'st thou then instead?"
I bowed my face in the pale evening gleam.
 Then gazed he on me with strange innocence:
 "Even in the grave thou wilt have thyself," he said.
