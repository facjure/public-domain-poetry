---

 On, loitering Muse, the swift Stream chides us on!
 Albeit his deep-worn channel doth immure
 Objects immense portrayed in miniature,
 Wild shapes for many a strange comparison!
 Niagaras, Alpine passes, and anon
 Abodes of Naiads, calm abysses pure,
 Bright liquid mansions, fashioned to endure
 When the broad oak drops, a leafless skeleton,
 And the solidities of mortal pride,
 Palace and tower, are crumbled into dust!
 The Bard who walks with Duddon for his guide,
 Shall find such toys of fancy thickly set:
 Turn from the sight, enamoured Muse, we must;
 And, if thou canst, leave them without regret!
