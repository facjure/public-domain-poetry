title: The Pibroch's Note
---

 The pibroch's note, discountenanced or mute;
 The Roman kilt, degraded to a toy
 Of quaint apparel for a half-spoilt boy;
 The target mouldering like ungathered fruit;
 The smoking steam-boat eager in pursuit,
 As eagerly pursued; the umbrella spread
 To weather-fend the Celtic herdsman's head
 All speak of manners withering to the root,
 And of old honours, too, and passions high:
 Then may we ask, though pleased that thought should range
 Among the conquests of civility,
 Survives imagination, to the change
 Superior? Help to virtue does she give?
 If not, O Mortals, better cease to live!
