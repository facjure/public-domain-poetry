 Father! to God himself we cannot give
 A holier name! then lightly do not bear
 Both names conjoined, but of thy spiritual care
 Be duly mindful: still more sensitive
 Do Thou, in truth a second Mother, strive
 Against disheartening custom, that by Thee
 Watched, and with love and pious industry
 Tended at need, the adopted Plant may thrive
 For everlasting bloom. Benign and pure
 This Ordinance, whether, loss it would supply,
 Prevent omission, help deficiency,
 Or seek to make assurance doubly sure.
 Shame if the consecrated Vow be found
 An idle form, the Word an empty sound!
