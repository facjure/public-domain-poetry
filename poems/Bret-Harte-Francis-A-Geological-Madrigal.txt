I have found out a gift for my fair;
I know where the fossils abound,
Where the footprints of Aves declare
The birds that once walked on the ground.
Oh, come, and in technical speech
We�ll walk this Devonian shore,
Or on some Silurian beach
We�ll wander, my love, evermore.

I will show thee the sinuous track
By the slow-moving Annelid made,
Or the Trilobite that, farther back,
In the old Potsdam sandstone was laid;
Thou shalt see, in his Jurassic tomb,
The Plesiosaurus embalmed;
In his Oolitic prime and his bloom,
Iguanodon safe and unharmed.

You wished I remember it well,
And I loved you the more for that wish
For a perfect cystedian shell
And a whole holocephalic fish.
And oh, if Earth�s strata contains
In its lowest Silurian drift,
Or palaeozoic remains
The same, �tis your lover�s free gift!

Then come, love, and never say nay,
But calm all your maidenly fears;
We�ll note, love, in one summer�s day
The record of millions of years;
And though the Darwinian plan
Your sensitive feelings may shock,
We�ll find the beginning of man,
Our fossil ancestors, in rock!
