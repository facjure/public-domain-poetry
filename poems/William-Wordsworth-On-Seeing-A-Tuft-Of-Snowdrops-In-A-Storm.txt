title: On Seeing A Tuft Of Snowdrops In A Storm
---

 When haughty expectations prostrate lie,
 And grandeur crouches like a guilty thing,
 Oft shall the lowly weak, till nature bring
 Mature release, in fair society
 Survive, and Fortune's utmost anger try;
 Like these frail snowdrops that together cling,
 And nod their helmets, smitten by the wing
 Of many a furious whirl-blast sweeping by.
 Observe the faithful flowers! if small to great
 May lead the thoughts, thus struggling used to stand
 The Emathian phalanx, nobly obstinate;
 And so the bright immortal Theban band,
 Whom onset, fiercely urged at Jove's command,
 Might overwhelm, but could not separate!
