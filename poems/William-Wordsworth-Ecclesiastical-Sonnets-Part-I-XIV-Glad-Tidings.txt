 For ever hallowed be this morning fair,
 Blest be the unconscious shore on which ye tread,
 And blest the silver Cross, which ye, instead
 Of martial banner, in procession bear;
 The Cross preceding Him who floats in air,
 The pictured Saviour! By Augustin led,
 They come, and onward travel without dread,
 Chanting in barbarous ears a tuneful prayer
 Sung for themselves, and those whom they would free!
 Rich conquest waits them: the tempestuous sea
 Of Ignorance, that ran so rough and high
 And heeded not the voice of clashing swords,
 These good men humble by a few bare words,
 And calm with fear of God's divinity.
