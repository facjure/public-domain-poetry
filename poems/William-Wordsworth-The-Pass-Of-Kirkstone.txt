 I

 Within the mind strong fancies work.
 A deep delight the bosom thrills
 Oft as I pass along the fork
 Of these fraternal hills:
 Where, save the rugged road, we find
 No appanage of human kind,
 Nor hint of man; if stone or rock
 Seem not his handywork to mock
 By something cognizably shaped;
 Mockery or model roughly hewn,
 And left as if by earthquake strewn,
 Or from the Flood escaped:
 Altars for Druid service fit;
 (But where no fire was ever lit,
 Unless the glow-worm to the skies
 Thence offer nightly sacrifice)
 Wrinkled Egyptian monument;
 Green moss-grown tower; or hoary tent;
 Tents of a camp that never shall be razed 
 On which four thousand years have gazed!

 II

 Ye plough-shares sparkling on the slopes!
 Ye snow-white lambs that trip
 Imprisoned 'mid the formal props
 Of restless ownership!
 Ye trees, that may to-morrow fall
 To feed the insatiate Prodigal!
 Lawns, houses, chattels, groves, and fields,
 All that the fertile valley shields;
 Wages of folly baits of crime,
 Of life's uneasy game the stake,
 Playthings that keep the eyes awake
 Of drowsy, dotard Time; 
 O care! O guilt! O vales and plains,
 Here, 'mid his own unvexed domains,
 A Genius dwells, that can subdue
 At once all memory of You, 
 Most potent when mists veil the sky,
 Mists that distort and magnify;
 While the coarse rushes, to the sweeping breeze,
 Sigh forth their ancient melodies!

 III

 List to those shriller notes! 'that' march
 Perchance was on the blast,
 When, through this Height's inverted arch,
 Rome's earliest legion passed!
 They saw, adventurously impelled,
 And older eyes than theirs beheld,
 This block and yon, whose church-like frame
 Gives to this savage Pass its name.
 Aspiring Road! that lov'st to hide
 Thy daring in a vapoury bourn,
 Not seldom may the hour return
 When thou shalt be my guide:
 And I (as all men may find cause,
 When life is at a weary pause,
 And they have panted up the hill
 Of duty with reluctant will)
 Be thankful, even though tired and faint,
 For the rich bounties of constraint;
 Whence oft invigorating transports flow
 That choice lacked courage to bestow!

 IV

 My Soul was grateful for delight
 That wore a threatening brow;
 A veil is lifted can she slight
 The scene that opens now?
 Though habitation none appear,
 The greenness tells, man must be there;
 The shelter that the perspective
 Is of the clime in which we live;
 Where Toil pursues his daily round;
 Where Pity sheds sweet tears and Love,
 In woodbine bower or birchen grove,
 Inflicts his tender wound.
 Who comes not hither ne'er shall know
 How beautiful the world below;
 Nor can he guess how lightly leaps
 The brook adown the rocky steeps.
 Farewell, thou desolate Domain!
 Hope, pointing to the cultured plain,
 Carols like a shepherd-boy;
 And who is she? Can that be Joy!
 Who, with a sunbeam for her guide,
 Smoothly skims the meadows wide;
 While Faith, from yonder opening cloud,
 To hill and vale proclaims aloud,
 "Whate'er the weak may dread, the wicked dare,
 Thy lot, O Man, is good, thy portion, fair!"
