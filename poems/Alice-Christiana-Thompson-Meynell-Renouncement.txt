I must not think of thee; and, tired yet strong,
 I shun the thought that lurks in all delight--
 The thought of thee--and in the blue Heaven's height,
And in the sweetest passage of a song.

Oh, just beyond the fairest thoughts that throng
 This breast, the thought of thee waits, hidden yet bright;
 But it must never, never come in sight;
I must stop short of thee the whole day long.

But when sleep comes to close each difficult day,
 When night gives pause to the long watch I keep,
And all my bonds I needs must loose apart,

Must doff my will as raiment laid away,--
 With the first dream that comes with the first sleep
I run, I run, I am gathered to thy heart.
