(Moon Poems for the Children/Fairy-tales for the Children)

 No man should stand before the moon
 To make sweet song thereon,
 With dandified importance,
 His sense of humor gone.

 Nay, let us don the motley cap,
 The jester's chastened mien,
 If we would woo that looking-glass
 And see what should be seen.

 O mirror on fair Heaven's wall,
 We find there what we bring.
 So, let us smile in honest part
 And deck our souls and sing.

 Yea, by the chastened jest alone
 Will ghosts and terrors pass,
 And fays, or suchlike friendly things,
 Throw kisses through the glass.
