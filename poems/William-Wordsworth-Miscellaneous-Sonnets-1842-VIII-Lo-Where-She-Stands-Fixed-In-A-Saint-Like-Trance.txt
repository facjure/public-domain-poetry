title: Miscellaneous Sonnets, 1842 - VIII - Lo! Where She Stands Fixed In A Saint-Like Trance
---

 Lo! where she stands fixed in a saint-like trance,
 One upward hand, as if she needed rest
 From rapture, lying softly on her breast!
 Nor wants her eyeball an ethereal glance;
 But not the less, nay more, that countenance,
 While thus illumined, tells of painful strife
 For a sick heart made weary of this life
 By love, long crossed with adverse circumstance.
 Would She were now as when she hoped to pass
 At God's appointed hour to them who tread
 Heaven's sapphire pavement, yet breathed well content,
 Well pleased, her foot should print earth's common grass,
 Lived thankful for day's light, for daily bread,
 For health, and time in obvious duty spent.
