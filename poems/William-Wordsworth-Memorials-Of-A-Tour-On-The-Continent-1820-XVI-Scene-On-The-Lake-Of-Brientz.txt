 "What know we of the Blest above
 But that they sing and that they love?"
 Yet, if they ever did inspire
 A mortal hymn, or shaped the choir,
 Now, where those harvest Damsels float
 Homeward in their rugged Boat,
 (While all the ruffling winds are fled
 Each slumbering on some mountain's head)
 Now, surely, hath that gracious aid
 Been felt, that influence is displayed.
 Pupils of Heaven, in order stand
 The rustic Maidens, every hand
 Upon a Sister's shoulder laid,
 To chant, as glides the boat along,
 A simple, but a touching, song;
 To chant, as Angels do above,
 The melodies of Peace in love!
