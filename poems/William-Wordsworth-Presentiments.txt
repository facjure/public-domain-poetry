Presentiments! they judge not right
 Who deem that ye from open light
 Retire in fear of shame;
 All 'heaven-born' Instincts shun the touch
 Of vulgar sense, and, being such,
 Such privilege ye claim.

 The tear whose source I could not guess,
 The deep sigh that seemed fatherless,
 Were mine in early days;
 And now, unforced by time to part 
 With fancy, I obey my heart,
 And venture on your praise.

 What though some busy foes to good,
 Too potent over nerve and blood,
 Lurk near you, and combine
 To taint the health which ye infuse;
 This hides not from the moral Muse
 Your origin divine.

 How oft from you, derided Powers!
 Comes Faith that in auspicious hours 
 Builds castles, not of air:
 Bodings unsanctioned by the will
 Flow from your visionary skill,
 And teach us to beware.

 The bosom-weight, your stubborn gift,
 That no philosophy can lift,
 Shall vanish, if ye please,
 Like morning mist: and, where it lay,
 The spirits at your bidding play
 In gaiety and ease. 

 Star-guided contemplations move
 Through space, though calm, not raised above
 Prognostics that ye rule;
 The naked Indian of the wild,
 And haply, too, the cradled Child,
 Are pupils of your school.

 But who can fathom your intents,
 Number their signs or instruments?
 A rainbow, a sunbeam,
 A subtle smell that Spring unbinds, 
 Dead pause abrupt of midnight winds,
 An echo, or a dream.

 The laughter of the Christmas hearth
 With sighs of self-exhausted mirth
 Ye feelingly reprove;
 And daily, in the conscious breast,
 Your visitations are a test
 And exercise of love.

 When some great change gives boundless scope
 To an exulting Nation's hope, 
 Oft, startled and made wise
 By your low-breathed interpretings,
 The simply-meek foretaste the springs
 Of bitter contraries.

 Ye daunt the proud array of war,
 Pervade the lonely ocean far
 As sail hath been unfurled;
 For dancers in the festive hall
 What ghastly partners hath your call
 Fetched from the shadowy world. 

 'Tis said, that warnings ye dispense,
 Emboldened by a keener sense;
 That men have lived for whom,
 With dread precision, ye made clear
 The hour that in a distant year
 Should knell them to the tomb.

 Unwelcome insight! Yet there are,
 Blest times when mystery is laid bare,
 Truth shows a glorious face,
 While on that isthmus which commands 
 The councils of both worlds, she stands,
 Sage Spirits! by your grace.

 God, who instructs the brutes to scent
 All changes of the element,
 Whose wisdom fixed the scale
 Of natures, for our wants provides
 By higher, sometimes humbler, guides,
 When lights of reason fail.
