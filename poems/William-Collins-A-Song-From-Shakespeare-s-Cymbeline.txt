title: A Song From Shakespeare's Cymbeline

To fair Fidele�s grassy tomb 
Soft maids and village hinds shall bring
Each op�ning sweet, of earliest bloom,
And rifle all the breathing spring.


No wailing ghost shall dare appear,
To vex with shrieks this quiet grove:
But shepherd lads assemble here,
And melting virgins own their love.


No wither�d witch shall here be seen,
No goblins lead their nightly crew:
The female fays shall haunt the green,
And dress thy grave with pearly dew!


The redbreast oft at ev�ning hours
Shall kindly lend his little aid:
With hoary moss, and gather�d flow�rs,
To deck the ground where thou art laid.


When howling winds, and beating rain,
In tempests shake the sylvan cell,
Or midst the chase on ev�ry plain,
The tender thought on thee shall dwell.


Each lonely scene shall thee restore,
For thee the tear be duly shed:
Belov�d, till life could charm no more;
And mourn�d, till Pity�s self be dead.
