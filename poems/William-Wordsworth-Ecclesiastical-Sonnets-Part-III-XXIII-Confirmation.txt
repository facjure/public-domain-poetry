 The Young-ones gathered in from hill and dale,
 With holiday delight on every brow:
 'Tis passed away; far other thoughts prevail;
 For they are taking the baptismal Vow
 Upon their conscious selves; their own lips speak
 The solemn promise. Strongest sinews fail,
 And many a blooming, many a lovely, cheek
 Under the holy fear of God turns pale;
 While on each head his lawn-robed Servant lays
 An apostolic hand, and with prayer seals
 The Covenant. The Omnipotent will raise
 Their feeble Souls; and bear with 'his' regrets,
 Who, looking round the fair assemblage, feels
 That ere the Sun goes down their childhood sets.
