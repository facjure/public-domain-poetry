title: The Avon

 Avon, a precious, an immortal name!
 Yet is it one that other rivulets bear
 Like this unheard-of, and their channels wear
 Like this contented, though unknown to Fame:
 For great and sacred is the modest claim
 Of Streams to Nature's love, where'er they flow;
 And ne'er did Genius slight them, as they go,
 Tree, flower, and green herb, feeding without blame.
 But Praise can waste her voice on work of tears,
 Anguish, and death: full oft where innocent blood
 Has mixed its current with the limpid flood,
 Her heaven-offending trophies Glory rears:
 Never for like distinction may the good
 Shrink from 'thy' name, pure Rill, with unpleased ears.
