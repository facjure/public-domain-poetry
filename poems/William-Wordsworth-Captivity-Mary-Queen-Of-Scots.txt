 "As the cold aspect of a sunless way
 Strikes through the Traveller's frame with deadlier chill,
 Oft as appears a grove, or obvious hill,
 Glistening with unparticipated ray,
 Or shining slope where he must never stray;
 So joys, remembered without wish or will
 Sharpen the keenest edge of present ill,
 On the crushed heart a heavier burthen lay.
 Just Heaven, contract the compass of my mind
 To fit proportion with my altered state!
 Quench those felicities whose light I find
 Reflected in my bosom all too late!
 O be my spirit, like my thraldom, strait;
 And, like mine eyes that stream with sorrow, blind!"
