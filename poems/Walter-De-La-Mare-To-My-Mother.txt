 Thine is my all, how little when 'tis told
 Beside thy gold!
 Thine the first peace, and mine the livelong strife;
 Thine the clear dawn, and mine the night of life;
 Thine the unstained belief,
 Darkened in grief.

 Scarce even a flower but thine its beauty and name,
 Dimmed, yet the same;
 Never in twilight comes the moon to me,
 Stealing thro' those far woods, but tells of thee,
 Falls, dear, on my wild heart,
 And takes thy part.

 Thou art the child, and I - how steeped in age!
 A blotted page
 From that clear, little book life's taken away:
 How could I read it, dear, so dark the day?
 Be it all memory
 'Twixt thee and me!
