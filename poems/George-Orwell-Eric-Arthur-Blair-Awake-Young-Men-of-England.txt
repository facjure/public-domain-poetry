title: Awake! Young Men of England
---

Oh! give me the strength of the Lion,
The wisdom of reynard the Fox
And then I�ll hurl troops at the Germans
And give them the hardest of knocks.

Oh! think of the War Lord�s mailed fist,
That is striking at England today:
And think of the lives that our soldiers
Are fearlessly throwing away.

Awake! Oh you young men of England,
For if, when your Country�s in need,
You do not enlist by the thousand,
You truly are cowards indeed.
