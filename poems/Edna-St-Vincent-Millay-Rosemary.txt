 For the sake of some things
 That be now no more
 I will strew rushes
 On my chamber-floor,
 I will plant bergamot
 At my kitchen-door.

 For the sake of dim things
 That were once so plain
 I will set a barrel
 Out to catch the rain,
 I will hang an iron pot
 On an iron crane.

 Many things be dead and gone
 That were brave and gay;
 For the sake of these things
 I will learn to say,
 "An it please you, gentle sirs,"
 "Alack!" and "Well-a-day!"
