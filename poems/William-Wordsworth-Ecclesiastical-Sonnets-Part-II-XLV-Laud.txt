title: Ecclesiastical Sonnets - Part II. - XLV - Laud
---

 Prejudged by foes determined not to spare,
 An old weak Man for vengeance thrown aside,
 Laud, "in the painful art of dying" tried,
 (Like a poor bird entangled in a snare
 Whose heart still flutters, though his wings forbear
 To stir in useless struggle) hath relied
 On hope that conscious innocence supplied,
 And in his prison breathes celestial air.
 Why tarries then thy chariot? Wherefore stay,
 O Death! the ensanguined yet triumphant wheels,
 Which thou prepar'st, full often, to convey
 (What time a State with madding faction reels)
 The Saint or Patriot to the world that heals
 All wounds, all perturbations doth allay?
