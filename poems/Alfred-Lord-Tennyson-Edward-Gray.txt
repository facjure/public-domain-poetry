Sweet Emma Moreland of yonder town
Met me walking on yonder way;
�And have you lost your heart?� she said;
�And are you married yet, Edward Gray?�

Sweet Emma Moreland spoke to me;
Bitterly weeping I turn�d away:
�Sweet Emma Moreland, love no more
Can touch the heart of Edward Gray.

�Ellen Adair she loved me well,
Against her father�s and mother�s will;
To-day I sat for an hour and wept
By Ellen�s grave, on the windy hill.

�Shy she was, and I thought her cold,
Thought her proud, and fled over the sea;
Fill�d I was with folly and spite,
When Ellen Adair was dying for me.

�Cruel, cruel the words I said!
Cruelly came they back to-day:
�You�re too slight and fickle,� I said,
�To trouble the heart of Edward Gray.�

�There I put my face in the grass�
Whisper�d, �Listen to my despair;
I repent me of all I did;
Speak a little, Ellen Adair!�

�Then I took a pencil, and wrote
On the mossy stone, as I lay,
�Here lies the body of Ellen Adair;
And here the heart of Edward Gray!�

�Love may come, and love may go,
And fly, like a bird, from tree to tree;
But I will love no more, no more,
Till Ellen Adair come back to me.

�Bitterly wept I over the stone;
Bitterly weeping I turn�d away.
There lies the body of Ellen Adair!
And there the heart of Edward Gray!�
