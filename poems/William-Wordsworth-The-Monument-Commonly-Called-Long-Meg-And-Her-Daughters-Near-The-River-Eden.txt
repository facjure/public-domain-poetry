 A weight of awe, not easy to be borne,
 Fell suddenly upon my Spirit cast
 From the dread bosom of the unknown past,
 When first I saw that family forlorn.
 Speak Thou, whose massy strength and stature scorn
 The power of years pre-eminent, and placed
 Apart, to overlook the circle vast
 Speak, Giant-mother! tell it to the Morn
 While she dispels the cumbrous shades of Night;
 Let the Moon hear, emerging from a cloud;
 At whose behest uprose on British ground
 That Sisterhood, in hieroglyphic round
 Forth-shadowing, some have deemed, the infinite
 The inviolable God, that tames the proud!
