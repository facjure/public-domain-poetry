I

The church flings forth a battled shade
 Over the moon-blanched sward;
The church; my gift; whereto I paid
 My all in hand and hoard:
 Lavished my gains
 With stintless pains
 To glorify the Lord.

II

I squared the broad foundations in
 Of ashlared masonry;
I moulded mullions thick and thin,
 Hewed fillet and ogee;
 I circleted
 Each sculptured head
 With nimb and canopy.

III

I called in many a craftsmaster
 To fix emblazoned glass,
To figure Cross and Sepulchre
 On dossal, boss, and brass.
 My gold all spent,
 My jewels went
 To gem the cups of Mass.

IV

I borrowed deep to carve the screen
 And raise the ivoried Rood;
I parted with my small demesne
 To make my owings good.
 Heir-looms unpriced
 I sacrificed,
 Until debt-free I stood.

V

So closed the task. "Deathless the Creed
 Here substanced!" said my soul:
"I heard me bidden to this deed,
 And straight obeyed the call.
 Illume this fane,
 That not in vain
 I build it, Lord of all!"

VI

But, as it chanced me, then and there
 Did dire misfortunes burst;
My home went waste for lack of care,
 My sons rebelled and curst;
 Till I confessed
 That aims the best
 Were looking like the worst.

VII

Enkindled by my votive work
 No burning faith I find;
The deeper thinkers sneer and smirk,
 And give my toil no mind;
 From nod and wink
 I read they think
 That I am fool and blind.

VIII

My gift to God seems futile, quite;
 The world moves as erstwhile;
And powerful wrong on feeble right
 Tramples in olden style.
 My faith burns down,
 I see no crown;
 But Cares, and Griefs, and Guile.

IX

So now, the remedy? Yea, this:
 I gently swing the door
Here, of my fane - no soul to wis -
 And cross the patterned floor
 To the rood-screen
 That stands between
 The nave and inner chore.

X

The rich red windows dim the moon,
 But little light need I;
I mount the prie-dieu, lately hewn
 From woods of rarest dye;
 Then from below
 My garment, so,
 I draw this cord, and tie

XI

One end thereof around the beam
 Midway 'twixt Cross and truss:
I noose the nethermost extreme,
 And in ten seconds thus
 I journey hence -
 To that land whence
 No rumour reaches us.

XII

Well: Here at morn they'll light on one
 Dangling in mockery
Of what he spent his substance on
 Blindly and uselessly! . . .
 "He might," they'll say,
 "Have built, some way.
 A cheaper gallows-tree!"
