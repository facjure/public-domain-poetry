 Queen of the stars! so gentle, so benign,
 That ancient Fable did to thee assign,
 When darkness creeping o'er thy silver brow
 Warned thee these upper regions to forego,
 Alternate empire in the shades below 
 A Bard, who, lately near the wide-spread sea
 Traversed by gleaming ships, looked up to thee
 With grateful thoughts, doth now thy rising hail
 From the close confines of a shadowy vale.
 Glory of night, conspicuous yet serene,
 Nor less attractive when by glimpses seen
 Through cloudy umbrage, well might that fair face,
 And all those attributes of modest grace,
 In days when Fancy wrought unchecked by fear,
 Down to the green earth fetch thee from thy sphere,
 To sit in leafy woods by fountains clear!
 
 O still beloved (for thine, meek Power, are charms
 That fascinate the very Babe in arms,
 While he, uplifted towards thee, laughs outright,
 Spreading his little palms in his glad Mother's sight)
 
 O still beloved, once worshiped! Time, that frowns
 In his destructive flight on earthly crowns,
 Spares thy mild splendour; still those far-shot beams
 Tremble on dancing waves and rippling streams
 With stainless touch, as chaste as when thy praise
 Was sung by Virgin-choirs in festal lays;
 And through dark trials still dost thou explore
 Thy way for increase punctual as of yore,
 When teeming Matrons yielding to rude faith
 In mysteries of birth and life and death
 And painful struggle and deliverance prayed
 Of thee to visit them with lenient aid.
 What though the rites be swept away, the fanes
 Extinct that echoed to the votive strains;
 Yet thy mild aspect does not, cannot, cease
 Love to promote and purity and peace;
 And Fancy, unreproved, even yet may trace
 Faint types of suffering in thy beamless face.
 
 Then silent Monitress! let us not blind
 To worlds unthought of till the searching mind
 Of Science laid them open to mankind 
 Told, also, how the voiceless heavens declare
 God's glory; and acknowledging thy share
 In that blest charge; let us without offense
 To aught of highest, holiest, influence 
 Receive whatever good 'tis given thee to dispense.
 May sage and simple, catching with one eye
 The moral intimations of the sky,
 Learn from thy course, where'er their own be taken,
 "To look on tempests, and be never shaken;"
 To keep with faithful step the appointed way
 Eclipsing or eclipsed, by night or day,
 And from example of thy monthly range
 Gently to brook decline and fatal change;
 Meek, patient, steadfast, and with loftier scope,
 Than thy revival yields, for gladsome hope!
