 I listen, but no faculty of mine
 Avails those modulations to detect,
 Which, heard in foreign lands, the Swiss affect
 With tenderest passion; leaving him to pine
 (So fame reports) and die, his sweet-breathed kine
 Remembering, and green Alpine pastures decked
 With vernal flowers. Yet may we not reject
 The tale as fabulous. Here while I recline,
 Mindful how others by this simple Strain
 Are moved, for me upon this Mountain named
 Of God himself from dread pre-eminence,
 Aspiring thoughts, by memory reclaimed,
 Yield to the Music's touching influence;
 And joys of distant home my heart enchain.
