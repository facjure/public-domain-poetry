title: A Gravestone Upon The Floor In The Cloisters Of Worcester Cathedral
---

 "Miserrimus," and neither name nor date,
 Prayer, text, or symbol, graven upon the stone;
 Nought but that word assigned to the unknown,
 That solitary word, to separate
 From all, and cast a cloud around the fate
 Of him who lies beneath. Most wretched one,
 'Who' chose his epitaph? Himself alone
 Could thus have dared the grave to agitate,
 And claim, among the dead, this awful crown;
 Nor doubt that He marked also for his own
 Close to these cloistral steps a burial-place,
 That every foot might fall with heavier tread,
 Trampling upon his vileness. Stranger, pass
 Softly! To save the contrite, Jesus bled.
