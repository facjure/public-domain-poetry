title: To The Same Flower (Daisy)

 With little here to do or see
 Of things that in the great world be,
 Daisy! again I talk to thee,
 For thou art worthy,
 Thou unassuming Common-place
 Of Nature, with that homely face,
 And yet with something of a grace,
 Which Love makes for thee!

 Oft on the dappled turf at ease
 I sit, and play with similies,
 Loose types of things through all degrees,
 Thoughts of thy raising:
 And many a fond and idle name
 I give to thee, for praise or blame,
 As is the humour of the game,
 While I am gazing.

 A nun demure of lowly port;
 Or sprightly maiden, of Love's court,
 In thy simplicity the sport
 Of all temptations;
 A queen in crown of rubies drest;
 A starveling in a scanty vest;
 Are all, as seems to suit thee best,
 Thy appellations.

 A little cyclops, with one eye
 Staring to threaten and defy,
 That thought comes next, and instantly
 The freak is over,
 The shape will vanish, and behold
 A silver shield with boss of gold,
 That spreads itself, some faery bold
 In fight to cover!

 I see thee glittering from afar,
 And then thou art a pretty star;
 Not quite so fair as many are
 In heaven above thee!
 Yet like a star, with glittering crest,
 Self-poised in air thou seem'st to rest;
 May peace come never to his nest,
 Who shall reprove thee!

 Bright 'Flower'! for by that name at last,
 When all my reveries are past,
 I call thee, and to that cleave fast,
 Sweet silent creature!
 That breath'st with me in sun and air,
 Do thou, as thou art wont, repair
 My heart with gladness, and a share
 Of thy meek nature!
