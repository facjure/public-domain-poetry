 But here no cannon thunders to the gale;
 Upon the wave no haughty pendants cast
 A crimson splendour: lowly is the mast
 That rises here, and humbly spread, the sail;
 While, less disturbed than in the narrow Vale
 Through which with strange vicissitudes he passed,
 The Wanderer seeks that receptacle vast
 Where all his unambitious functions fail
 And may thy Poet, cloud-born Stream! be free
 The sweets of earth contentedly resigned,
 And each tumultuous working left behind
 At seemly distance, to advance like Thee;
 Prepared, in peace of heart, in calm of mind
 And soul, to mingle with Eternity!
