title: To Cordelia M�. - Hallsteads, Ullswater
---

 Not in the mines beyond the western main,
 You say, Cordelia, was the metal sought,
 Which a fine skill, of Indian growth, has wrought
 Into this flexible yet faithful Chain;
 Nor is it silver of romantic Spain
 But from our loved Helvellyn's depths was brought,
 Our own domestic mountain. Thing and thought
 Mix strangely; trifles light, and partly vain,
 Can prop, as you have learnt, our nobler being:
 Yes, Lady, while about your neck is wound
 (Your casual glance oft meeting) this bright cord,
 What witchery, for pure gifts of inward seeing,
 Lurks in it, Memory's Helper, Fancy's Lord,
 For precious tremblings in your bosom found!
