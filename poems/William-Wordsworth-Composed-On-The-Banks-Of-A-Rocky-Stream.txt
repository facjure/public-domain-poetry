 Dogmatic Teachers, of the snow-white fur!
 Ye wrangling Schoolmen, of the scarlet hood!
 Who, with a keenness not to be withstood,
 Press the point home, or falter and demur,
 Checked in your course by many a teasing burr;
 These natural council-seats your acrid blood
 Might cool; and, as the Genius of the flood
 Stoops willingly to animate and spur
 Each lighter function slumbering in the brain,
 Yon eddying balls of foam, these arrowy gleams
 That o'er the pavement of the surging streams
 Welter and flash, a synod might detain
 With subtle speculations, haply vain,
 But surely less so than your far-fetched themes!
