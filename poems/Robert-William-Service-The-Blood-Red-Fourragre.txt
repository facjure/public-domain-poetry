 What was the blackest sight to me
 Of all that campaign?
 A naked woman tied to a tree
 With jagged holes where her breasts should be,
 Rotting there in the rain.

 On we pressed to the battle fray,
 Dogged and dour and spent.
 Sudden I heard my Captain say:
 "Voil�! Kultur has passed this way,
 And left us a monument."

 So I looked and I saw our Colonel there,
 And his grand head, snowed with the years,
 Unto the beat of the rain was bare;
 And, oh, there was grief in his frozen stare,
 And his cheeks were stung with tears!

 Then at last he turned from the woeful tree,
 And his face like stone was set;
 "Go, march the Regiment past," said he,
 "That every father and son may see,
 And none may ever forget."

 Oh, the crimson strands of her hair downpoured
 Over her breasts of woe;
 And our grim old Colonel leaned on his sword,
 And the men filed past with their rifles lowered,
 Solemn and sad and slow.

 But I'll never forget till the day I die,
 As I stood in the driving rain,
 And the jaded columns of men slouched by,
 How amazement leapt into every eye,
 Then fury and grief and pain.

 And some would like madmen stand aghast,
 With their hands upclenched to the sky;
 And some would cross themselves as they passed,
 And some would curse in a scalding blast,
 And some like children cry.

 Yea, some would be sobbing, and some would pray,
 And some hurl hateful names;
 But the best had never a word to say;
 They turned their twitching faces away,
 And their eyes were like hot flames.

 They passed; then down on his bended knee
 The Colonel dropped to the Dead:
 "Poor martyred daughter of France!" said he,
 "O dearly, dearly avenged you'll be
 Or ever a day be sped!"

 Now they hold that we are the best of the best,
 And each of our men may wear,
 Like a gash of crimson across his chest,
 As one fierce-proved in the battle-test,
 The blood-red Fourrag�re.

 For each as he leaps to the top can see,
 Like an etching of blood on his brain,
 A wife or a mother lashed to a tree,
 With two black holes where her breasts should be,
 Left to rot in the rain.

 So we fight like fiends, and of us they say
 That we neither yield nor spare.
 Oh, we have the bitterest debt to pay. . . .
 Have we paid it? - Look - how we wear to-day
 Like a trophy, gallant and proud and gay,
 Our blood-red Fourrag�re.
