 Where be the noisy followers of the game
 Which faction breeds; the turmoil where? that passed
 Through Europe, echoing from the newsman's blast,
 And filled our hearts with grief for England's shame.
 Peace greets us; rambling on without an aim
 We mark majestic herds of cattle, free
 To ruminate, couched on the grassy lea;
 And hear far-off the mellow horn proclaim
 The Season's harmless pastime. Ruder sound
 Stirs not; enrapt I gaze with strange delight,
 While consciousnesses, not to be disowned,
 Here only serve a feeling to invite
 That lifts the spirit to a calmer height,
 And makes this rural stillness more profound.
