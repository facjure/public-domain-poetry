title: Oh What A Wreck! How Changed In Mien And Speech!
---

 Oh what a Wreck! how changed in mien and speech!
 Yet, though dread Powers, that work in mystery, spin
 Entanglings of the brain; though shadows stretch
 O'er the chilled heart reflect; far, far within
 Hers is a holy Being, freed from Sin.
 She is not what she seems, a forlorn wretch;
 But delegated Spirits comfort fetch
 To Her from heights that Reason may not win.
 Like Children, She is privileged to hold
 Divine communion; both do live and move,
 Whate'er to shallow Faith their ways unfold,
 Inly illumined by Heaven's pitying love;
 Love pitying innocence not long to last,
 In them, in Her our sins and sorrows past.
