title: Protest Against The Ballot

 Forth rushed from Envy sprung and Self-conceit,
 A Power misnamed the spirit of reform,
 And through the astonished Island swept in storm,
 Threatening to lay all orders at her feet
 That crossed her way. Now stoops she to entreat
 License to hide at intervals her head
 Where she may work, safe, undisquieted,
 In a close Box, covert for Justice meet.
 St, George of England! keep a watchful eye
 Fixed on the Suitor; frustrate her request
 Stifle her hope; for, if the State comply,
 From such Pandorian gift may come a Pest
 Worse than the Dragon that bowed low his crest,
 Pierced by thy spear in glorious victory.
