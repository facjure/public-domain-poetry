title: Soft As A Cloud Is Yon Blue Ridge
---

 Soft as a cloud is yon blue Ridge, the Mere
 Seems firm as solid crystal, breathless, clear,
 And motionless; and, to the gazer's eye,
 Deeper than ocean, in the immensity
 Of its vague mountains and unreal sky!
 But, from the process in that still retreat,
 Turn to minuter changes at our feet;
 Observe how dewy Twilight has withdrawn
 The crowd of daisies from the shaven lawn,
 And has restored to view its tender green,
 That, while the sun rode high, was lost beneath their dazzling sheen.
 
 An emblem this of what the sober Hour
 Can do for minds disposed to feel its power!
 Thus oft, when we in vain have wished away
 The petty pleasures of the garish day,
 Meek eve shuts up the whole usurping host
 (Unbashful dwarfs each glittering at his post)
 And leaves the disencumbered spirit free
 To reassume a staid simplicity.
 
 'Tis well--but what are helps of time and place,
 When wisdom stands in need of nature's grace;
 Why do good thoughts, invoked or not, descend,
 Like Angels from their bowers, our virtues to befriend;
 If yet To-morrow, unbelied, may say,
 "I come to open out, for fresh display,
 The elastic vanities of yesterday"?
