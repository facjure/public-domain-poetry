My Fair, no beauty of thine will last
 Save in my love's eternity.
 Thy smiles, that light thee fitfully,
Are lost for ever--their moment past--
 Except the few thou givest to me.

Thy sweet words vanish day by day,
 As all breath of mortality;
 Thy laughter, done, must cease to be,
And all thy dear tones pass away,
 Except the few that sing to me.

Hide then within my heart, oh, hide
 All thou art loth should go from thee.
 Be kinder to thyself and me.
My cupful from this river's tide
 Shall never reach the long sad sea.
