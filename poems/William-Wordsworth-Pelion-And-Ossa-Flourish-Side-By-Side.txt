title: Pelion And Ossa Flourish Side By Side
---

 Pelion and Ossa flourish side by side,
 Together in immortal books enrolled:
 His ancient dower Olympus hath not sold;
 And that inspiring Hill, which "did divide
 Into two ample horns his forehead wide,"
 Shines with poetic radiance as of old;
 While not an English Mountain we behold
 By the celestial Muses glorified.
 Yet round our sea-girt shore they rise in crowds:
 What was the great Parnassus' self to Thee,
 Mount Skiddaw? In his natural sovereignty
 Our British Hill is nobler far; he shrouds
 His double front among Atlantic clouds,
 And pours forth streams more sweet than Castaly.
