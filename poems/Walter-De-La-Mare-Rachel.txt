 Rachel sings sweet - 
Oh yes, at night,
 Her pale face bent
In the candle-light,
 Her slim hands touch
The answering keys,
 And she sings of hope
And of memories:
 Sings to the little
Boy that stands
 Watching those slim,
Light, heedful hands.
 He looks in her face;
Her dark eyes seem
 Dark with a beautiful
Distant dream;
 And still she plays,
Sings tenderly
 To him of hope,
And of memory.
