 Excuse is needless when with love sincere
 Of occupation, not by fashion led,
 Thou turn'st the Wheel that slept with dust o'erspread;
 'My' nerves from no such murmur shrink, tho' near,
 Soft as the Dorhawk's to a distant ear,
 When twilight shades darken the mountain's head.
 Even She who toils to spin our vital thread
 Might smile on work, O Lady, once so dear
 To household virtues. Venerable Art,
 Torn from the Poor! yet shall kind Heaven protect
 Its own; though Rulers, with undue respect,
 Trusting to crowded factory and mart
 And proud discoveries of the intellect,
 Heed not the pillage of man's ancient heart.
