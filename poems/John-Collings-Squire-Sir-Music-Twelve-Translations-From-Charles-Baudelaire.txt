 Oft Music, as it were some moving mighty sea,
 Bears me towards my pale
 Star: in clear space, or 'neath a vaporous canopy
 On-floating, I set sail.

 With heaving chest which strains forward, and lungs outblown,
 I climb the ridg�d steeps
 Of those high-pil�d clouds which 'thwart the night are thrown,
 Veiling its starry deeps.

 I suffer all the throes, within my quivering form,
 Of a great ship in pain,
 Now a soft wind, and now the writhings of a storm

 Upon the vasty main
 Rock me: at other times a death-like calm, the bare
 Mirror of my despair.
