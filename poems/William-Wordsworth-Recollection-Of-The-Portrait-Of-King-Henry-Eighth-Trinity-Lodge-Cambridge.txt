 The imperial Stature, the colossal stride,
 Are yet before me; yet do I behold
 The broad full visage, chest of amplest mould,
 The vestments 'broidered with barbaric pride:
 And lo! a poniard, at the Monarch's side,
 Hangs ready to be grasped in sympathy
 With the keen threatenings of that fulgent eye,
 Below the white-rimmed bonnet, far-descried,
 Who trembles now at thy capricious mood?
 'Mid those surrounding Worthies, haughty King,
 We rather think, with grateful mind sedate,
 How Providence educeth, from the spring
 Of lawless will, unlooked-for streams of good,
 Which neither force shall check nor time abate!
