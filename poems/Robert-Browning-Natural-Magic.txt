All I can say is, I saw it!
The room was as bare as your hand.
I locked in the swarth little lady, I swear,
From the head to the foot of her, well, quite as bare!
�No Nautch shall cheat me,� said I, �taking my stand
At this bolt which I draw!� And this bolt, I withdraw it,
And there laughs the lady, not bare, but embowered
With, who knows what verdure, o�erfruited, o�erflowered?
Impossible! Only, I saw it!

All I can sing is, I feel it!
This life was as blank as that room;
I let you pass in here. Precaution, indeed?
Walls, ceiling and floor, not a chance for a weed!
Wide opens the entrance: where�s cold now, where�s gloom?
No May to sow seed here, no June to reveal it,
Behold you enshrined in these blooms of your bringing,
These fruits of your bearing, nay, birds of your winging!
A fairy-tale! Only, I feel it!
