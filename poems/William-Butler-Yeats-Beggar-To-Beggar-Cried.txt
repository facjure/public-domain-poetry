title: Beggar To Beggar Cried
---

�Time to put off the world and go somewhere
And find my health again in the sea air,�
Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
�And make my soul before my pate is bare.�

�And get a comfortable wife and house
To rid me of the devil in my shoes,�
Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
�And the worse devil that is between my thighs.�

�And though I�d marry with a comely lass,
She need not be too comely, let it pass,�
Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
�But there�s a devil in a looking-glass.�

�Nor should she be too rich, because the rich
Are driven by wealth as beggars by the itch,�
Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
�And cannot have a humorous happy speech.�

�And there I�ll grow respected at my ease,
And hear amid the garden�s nightly peace,�
Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
�The wind-blown clamour of the barnacle-geese.�
