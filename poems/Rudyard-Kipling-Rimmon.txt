Duly with knees that feign to quake,
 Bent head and shaded brow,,
Yet once again, for my father's sake,
 In Rimmon's House I bow.

The curtains part, the trumpet blares,
 And the eunuchs howl aloud;
And the gilt, swag-bellied idol glares
 Insolent over the crowd.

"This is Rimmon, Lord of the Earth,
 "Fear Him and bow the knee!"
And I watch my comrades hide their mirth
 That rode to the wars with me.

For we remember the sun and the sand
 And the rocks whereon we trod,
Ere we came to a scorched and a scornful land
 That did not know our God;

As we remember the sacrifice,
 Dead men an hundred laid,
Slain while they served His mysteries,
 And that He would not aid,

Not though we gashed ourselves and wept,
 For the high-priest bade us wait;
Saying He went on a journey or slept,
 Or was drunk or had taken a mate.

(Praise ye Rimmon, King of Kings,
 Who ruleth Earth and Sky!
And again I bow as the censer swings
 And the God Enthroned goes by.)

Ay, we remember His sacred ark
 And the virtuous men that knelt
To the dark and the hush behind the dark
 Wherein we dreamed He dwelt;
