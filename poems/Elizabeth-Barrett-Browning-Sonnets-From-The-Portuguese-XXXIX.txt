Because thou hast the power and own�st the grace
To look through and behind this mask of me,
(Against which, years have beat thus blanchingly,
With their rains,) and behold my soul�s true face,
The dim and weary witness of life�s race,
Because thou hast the faith and love to see,
Through that same soul�s distracting lethargy,
The patient angel waiting for a place
In the new Heavens, because nor sin nor woe,
Nor God�s infliction, nor death�s neighbourhood,
Nor all which others viewing, turn to go,
Nor all which makes me tired of all, self-viewed,
Nothing repels thee, . . . Dearest, teach me so
To pour out gratitude, as thou dost, good!
