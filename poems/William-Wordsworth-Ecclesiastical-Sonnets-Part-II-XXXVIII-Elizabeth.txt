 Hail, Virgin Queen! o'er many an envious bar
 Triumphant, snatched from many a treacherous wile!
 All hail, sage Lady, whom a grateful Isle
 Hath blest, respiring from that dismal war
 Stilled by thy voice! But quickly from afar
 Defiance breathes with more malignant aim;
 And alien storms with home-bred ferments claim
 Portentous fellowship. Her silver car,
 By sleepless prudence ruled, glides slowly on;
 Unhurt by violence, from menaced taint
 Emerging pure, and seemingly more bright:
 Ah! wherefore yields it to a foul constraint
 Black as the clouds its beams dispersed, while shone,
 By men and angels blest, the glorious light?
