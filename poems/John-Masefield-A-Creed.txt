title: A Creed

I hold that when a person dies
His soul returns again to earth; 
Arrayed in some new flesh-disguise
Another mother gives him birth. 
With sturdier limbs and brighter brain
The old soul takes the road again.

Such is my own belief and trust;
This hand, this hand that holds the pen, 
Has many a hundred times been dust
And turned, as dust, to dust again; 
These eyes of mine have blinked and shown
In Thebes, in Troy, in Babylon.

All that I rightly think or do,
Or make, or spoil, or bless, or blast, 
Is curse or blessing justly due
For sloth or effort in the past. 
My life's a statement of the sum
Of vice indulged, or overcome.

I know that in my lives to be
My sorry heart will ache and burn, 
And worship, unavailingly,
The woman whom I used to spurn, 
And shake to see another have
The love I spurned, the love she gave.

And I shall know, in angry words,
In gibes, and mocks, and many a tear, 
A carrion flock of homing-birds,
The gibes and scorns I uttered here. 
The brave word that I failed to speak
Will brand me dastard on the cheek.

And as I wander on the roads
I shall be helped and healed and blessed; 
Dear words shall cheer and be as goads
To urge to heights before unguessed. 
My road shall be the road I made;
All that I gave shall be repaid.

So shall I fight, so shall I tread,
In this long war beneath the stars; 
So shall a glory wreathe my head,
So shall I faint and show the scars, 
Until this case, this clogging mould,
Be smithied all to kingly gold.
