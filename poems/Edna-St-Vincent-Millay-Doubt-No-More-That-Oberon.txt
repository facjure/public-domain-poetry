title: Doubt No More That Oberon

 Doubt no more that Oberon--
 Never doubt that Pan
 Lived, and played a reed, and ran
 After nymphs in a dark forest,
 In the merry, credulous days,--
 Lived, and led a fairy band
 Over the indulgent land!
 Ah, for in this dourest, sorest
 Age man's eye has looked upon,
 Death to fauns and death to fays,
 Still the dog-wood dares to raise--
 Healthy tree, with trunk and root--
 Ivory bowls that bear no fruit,
 And the starlings and the jays--
 Birds that cannot even sing--
 Dare to come again in spring!
