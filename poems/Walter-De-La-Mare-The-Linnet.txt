 Upon this leafy bush
With thorns and roses in it,
 Flutters a thing of light,
A twittering linnet.
 And all the throbbing world
Of dew and sun and air
 By this small parcel of life
Is made more fair;
 As if each bramble-spray
 And mounded gold-wreathed furze,
Harebell and little thyme,
Were only hers;
 As if this beauty and grace
Did to one bird belong,
 And, at a flutter of wing,
Might vanish in song.
