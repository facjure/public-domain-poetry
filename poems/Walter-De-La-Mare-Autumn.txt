 There is a wind where the rose was;
 Cold rain where sweet grass was;
And clouds like sheep
Stream o'er the steep
 Grey skies where the lark was.

 Nought gold where your hair was;
 Nought warm where your hand was;
But phantom, forlorn,
Beneath the thorn,
 Your ghost where your face was.

 Sad winds where your voice was;
 Tears, tears where my heart was;
And ever with me,
Child, ever with me,
 Silence where hope was.
