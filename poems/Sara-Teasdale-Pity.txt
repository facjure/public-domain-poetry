---

They never saw my lover�s face,
They only know our love was brief,
Wearing awhile a windy grace
And passing like an autumn leaf.

They wonder why I do not weep,
They think it strange that I can sing,
They say, �Her love was scarcely deep
Since it has left so slight a sting.�

They never saw my love, nor knew
That in my heart�s most secret place
I pity them as angels do

Men who have never seen God�s face.
