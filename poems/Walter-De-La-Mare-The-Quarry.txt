 You hunted me with all the pack,
Too blind, too blind, to see
 By no wild hope of force or greed
Could you make sure of me.

 And like a phantom through the glades,
With tender breast aglow,
 The goddess in me laughed to hear
Your horns a-roving go.

 She laughed to think no mortal ever
By dint of mortal flesh
 The very Cause that was the Hunt
One moment could enmesh:

 That though with captive limbs I lay,
Stilled breath and vanquished eyes,
 He that hunts Love with horse and hound
Hunts out his heart and eyes.
