 Grieve for the Man who hither came bereft,
 And seeking consolation from above;
 Nor grieve the less that skill to him was left
 To paint this picture of his lady-love:
 Can she, a blessed saint, the work approve?
 And oh, good Brethren of the cowl, a thing
 So fair, to which with peril he must cling,
 Destroy in pity, or with care remove.
 That bloom, those eyes, can they assist to bind
 Thoughts that would stray from Heaven? The dream must cease
 To be; by Faith, not sight, his soul must live;
 Else will the enamoured Monk too surely find
 How wide a space can part from inward peace
 The most profound repose his cell can give.
