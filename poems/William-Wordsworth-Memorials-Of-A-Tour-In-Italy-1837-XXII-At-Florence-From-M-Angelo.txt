 Eternal Lord! eased of a cumbrous load,
 And loosened from the world, I turn to Thee;
 Shun, like a shattered bark, the storm, and flee
 To thy protection for a safe abode.
 The crown of thorns, hands pierced upon the tree,
 The meek, benign, and lacerated face,
 To a sincere repentance promise grace,
 To the sad soul give hope of pardon free.
 With justice mark not Thou, O Light divine,
 My fault, nor hear it with thy sacred ear;
 Neither put forth that way thy arm severe;
 Wash with thy blood my sins; thereto incline
 More readily the more my years require
 Help, and forgiveness speedy and entire.
