 OH, come again to Astolat!
 I will not ask you to be kind.
 And you may go when you will go,
 And I will stay behind.

 I will not say how dear you are,
 Or ask you if you hold me dear,
 Or trouble you with things for you
 The way I did last year.

 So still the orchard, Lancelot,
 So very still the lake shall be,
 You could not guess--though you should guess--
 What is become of me.

 So wide shall be the garden-walk,
 The garden-seat so very wide,
 You needs must think--if you should think--
 The lily maid had died.

 Save that, a little way away,
 I'd watch you for a little while,
 To see you speak, the way you speak,
 And smile,--if you should smile.
