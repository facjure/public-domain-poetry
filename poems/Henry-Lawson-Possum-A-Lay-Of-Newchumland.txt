So yer trav�lin� for yer pleasure while yer writin� for the press?
An� yer huntin� arter �copy�? well, I�ve heer�d o� that. I guess
You are gorn ter write a story that is gorn ter be yer best,
�Bout the �blunders an� advenchers ov a new chum in the west?�
An� you would be very thankful an� acknowledge any hint?
Well, I karn�t say as I hankers fur ter see my name in print;
But I know a little story an� I�ll tell it out ov hand
If yer�ll put it down in writin� that the swells kin understand
(It�s a story ov a new chum, and a story ov the land.)


He had lately kum from Ingland you cud tell it by �s cap
Fur �kerlonial exper�ence� (an� he got it, too, poor chap).
�Twas in town he met the squatter, an� he asked, as if in fun,
�If the boss �ud want a flunkey or a coachy on the run?�
Well, it riz the boss�s dander, an� he jumps clean orf �is �oss
�Now, me fresh, sweet-scented beauty, watyer giv�nus?� sez the boss;
�I hev met yer kidney often, an� yer mighty fresh an� free,
But yer needn�t think yer gorn ter come a-lardin� over me!�


But the new chum sed that �onest he was lookin� for a job,
An� in spite of his appearance he had blued �is bottom bob.
An� as beggars karn�t be choosers same as people wot are rich,
Said he�d go as stoo�rd or gard�ner, but he warn�t partickler which.
Well, the joker seemed in earnest, so the boss began ter cool,
An� he only blanked the new chum for a thund�rin� jumpt-up fool.
Then he sed, �Well, there�s the fencin�, if yer�ll tramp it up from Perth,
The boys �ll find yer su�thin p�r�aps, an� giv� yer wat yer worth.�


Ov course the squatter never thort ter see �im any more,
But he wa�n�t the kind ov new chum that the squatter tuk �im for;
No, he wa�n�t the kind er cockeroach that on�y kums ter shirk,
That wants ter git the sugar, but is fri�tened ov the work;
For he sold �is watch �n� jool�ry, �n� lardi-dardy suits,
Stuck a swag upon his shoulder, �n� �is feet in blucher boots;
An� I dunno how he did it, he was anythin� but strong,
But he �umped his bluey ninety mile an� kum to Bunglelong.

He earnt �is pound and tucker borin� holes an� runnin� wire,
An� he�d work from dawn to sunset, an� he never seemed to tire;
But he must have suffered orful from the tucker an� the heat,
An� the everlastin� trampin� made �im tender in the feet,
An� he must hev thort ov England w�en the everlastin� flies
Ware a-worrit, worrit, worrit, an� a-knawin� at �is eyes;
An� he used to swear like thunder w�en the yaller sergeant ants
Took a mornin� stroll, promiscus, on the inside ov �is pants.

He uster make �is damper six or seven inches thick
It was doughey on the inside an� the shell was like a brick,
An� while the damper made �im dream ov days ov long ago,
The little boodie rats �ud kum an� nibble out the dough.
He biled �is taters soggy, an� �is junk was biled to rags
(The little boodie rats �ud kum an� chew �s tucker bags),
But he took �is troubles cheerful, an� he fixed �em like a pome,
An� writ �em in his darey to amuse the folks at home.

At first he flashed a coller an� was keerful with �is hat,
An� he�d black �is boots ov Sundays, but he soon grew out of that;
An� he lernt ter bake �is damper, an� he leant to bile �is junk
An� sleep without a-getting up all night ter shake �is bunk.
He soon got out ov takin� �shorter cuts� across the flats,
An� he learnt to fling ole bottles to the sorror of the rats,
An� learnt to sling kerlonial and like the bushman�s way,
An� it did us good to see �im smoke �is �nigger� in a clay.

He would sing an� play �is fiddle when we gathered round the blaze,
Till ole Frenchy got excited while he�d play the Mascylays;
An� Bill �ud take �is hat off while he�d spout the Light Brigade,
An� Scotchy got oneasy when the �Bony �Ills� was played.
So we got ter like the new chum for we�d met with many wuss,
An� we made it easy for �im an� he seemed to take to us:
The toilin� an� the trampin� was a-cookin� �im we found,
So we made �im cook an� stoo�rd just ter keep the chap around.

Well, the months went bakin� broilin� on until Christmas nex�,
When we tramped it down to Perth to spend our �ollyday (and cheques);
But Possum sed he�d save �is tin an� stay and mind the camp,
So we left �im in possession an� we started on our tramp;
(We useter call �im Possum, but for short we called �im Poss,
For �is eyes was black an� twinklin� and a little chap he was),
We never would have left �im if we�d know�d (but that�s the rub),
Comin� back we found �im dyin� in �is gunyah in the scrub.

We fixed �im up an� nursed �im; but we seen without a doubt
That consumption was the matter, an� the chap was peggin� out;
But the lion heart inside �im was as strong an� stout as six,
An� while he�d smile an� thank us he would joke about �is fix;
An� he said �twas very jolly to be dry-nursed in a tent,
An� he reckoned that the Christmas was the best he�d ever spent;
He would talk of �ome and Inglan� when �is head began ter swim,
But he never blamed the country that had been so �ard on him.

He would say, �I like the country; if a feller�s blind er halt,
Or if he�s got konsumption, why it ain�t the country�s fault.
The tea that�s boil�d in billies is far sweeter stuff, I know,
Than the cursed drink w�at blasted all my chances long ago.
I would hev cum out sooner if it was my destiny,
An� I daresay that the country would have made a man ov me.
But w�at�s the good ov energy, an� wat�s the good er �push�
W�en a feller�s sick an� dyin� in a gunyah in the bush.�

But he tole me all about it as I sat beside �is bunk
How he�d spent �is tin in Melbourne an� was allers gettin� drunk;
How he thort he�d take it easy while he had a little gold,
And, before he turned the new leaf, how he scribbled on the old;
An� among a lot ov nonsense w�en �is mind began to drift,
He told me that the new leaf was a heavy leaf to lift.
But w�ats the good er writin� this, it�s nothin� very new,
The land will see enough ov it an� suffer for it, too.
An� he said w�en he was dying, (when his lung was spit away)
An� we all was standin� round �im in the gunyah where he lay,
An� he said, �I�ve watched the sunset when the wind began to �woosh�,
Like a layer ov coals a-glowin� on the dark bed ov the bush;
An� I felt my fingers slippin� slippin� slowly from the ropes,
Wen the West was cold like ashes like the ashes of my hopes;
An� I Sit beside me Peter let me �old a bushman�s hand,
For I�m gorn to �ump my bluey through the gates ov Newchumland.�
