title: Sonnets - II. - Roman Antiquities Discovered At Bishopstone, Herefordshire
---

 While poring Antiquarians search the ground
 Upturned with curious pains, the Bard, a Seer,
 Takes fire: The men that have been reappear;
 Romans for travel girt, for business gowned;
 And some recline on couches, myrtle-crowned,
 In festal glee: why not? For fresh and clear,
 As if its hues were of the passing year,
 Dawns this time-buried pavement. From that mound
 Hoards may come forth of Trajans, Maximins,
 Shrunk into coins with all their warlike toil:
 Or a fierce impress issues with its foil
 Of tenderness the Wolf, whose suckling Twins
 The unlettered ploughboy pities when he wins
 The casual treasure from the furrowed soil.
