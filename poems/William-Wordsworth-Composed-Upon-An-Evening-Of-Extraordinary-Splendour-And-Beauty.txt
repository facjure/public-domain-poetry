 I

 Had this effulgence disappeared
 With flying haste, I might have sent,
 Among the speechless clouds, a look
 Of blank astonishment;
 But 'tis endued with power to stay,
 And sanctify one closing day,
 That frail Mortality may see,
 What is? ah no, but what 'can' be!
 Time was when field and watery cove
 With modulated echoes rang,
 While choirs of fervent Angels sang
 Their vespers in the grove;
 Or, crowning, star-like, each some sovereign height,
 Warbled, for heaven above and earth below,
 Strains suitable to both. Such holy rite,
 Methinks, if audibly repeated now
 From hill or valley, could not move
 Sublimer transport, purer love,
 Than doth this silent spectacle, the gleam,
 The shadow and the peace supreme!

 II

 No sound is uttered, but a deep
 And solemn harmony pervades
 The hollow vale from steep to steep,
 And penetrates the glades.
 Far-distant images draw nigh,
 Called forth by wondrous potency
 Of beamy radiance, that imbues,
 Whate'er it strikes, with gem-like hues!
 In vision exquisitely clear,
 Herds range along the mountain side;
 And glistening antlers are descried;
 And gilded flocks appear.
 Thine is the tranquil hour, purpureal Eve!
 But long as god-like wish, or hope divine,
 Informs my spirit, ne'er can I believe
 That this magnificence is wholly thine!
 From worlds not quickened by the sun
 A portion of the gift is won;
 An intermingling of Heaven's pomp is spread
 On ground which British shepherds tread!

 III

 And, if there be whom broken ties
 Afflict, or injuries assail,
 Yon hazy ridges to their eyes
 Present a glorious scale,
 Climbing suffused with sunny air,
 To stop, no record hath told where!
 And tempting Fancy to ascend,
 And with immortal Spirits blend!
 Wings at my shoulders seem to play;
 But, rooted here, I stand and gaze
 On those bright steps that heavenward raise
 Their practicable way.
 Come forth, ye drooping old men, look abroad,
 And see to what fair countries ye are bound!
 And if some traveller, weary of his road,
 Hath slept since noon-tide on the grassy ground,
 Ye Genii! to his covert speed;
 And wake him with such gentle heed
 As may attune his soul to meet the dower
 Bestowed on this transcendent hour!

 IV

 Such hues from their celestial Urn
 Were wont to stream before mine eye,
 Where'er it wandered in the morn
 Of blissful infancy.
 This glimpse of glory, why renewed?
 Nay, rather speak with gratitude;
 For, if a vestige of those gleams
 Survived, 'twas only in my dreams.
 Dread Power! whom peace and calmness serve
 No less than Nature's threatening voice,
 If aught unworthy be my choice,
 From THEE if I would swerve;
 Oh, let thy grace remind me of the light
 Full early lost, and fruitlessly deplored;
 Which, at this moment, on my waking sight
 Appears to shine, by miracle restored;
 My soul, though yet confined to earth,
 Rejoices in a second birth!
 'Tis past, the visionary splendour fades;
 And night approaches with her shades.
