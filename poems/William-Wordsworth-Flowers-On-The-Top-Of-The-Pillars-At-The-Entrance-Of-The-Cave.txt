title: Flowers On The Top Of The Pillars At The Entrance Of The Cave
---

 Hope smiled when your nativity was cast,
 Children of Summer! Ye fresh Flowers that brave
 What Summer here escapes not, the fierce wave,
 And whole artillery of the western blast,
 Battering the Temple's front, its long-drawn nave
 Smiting, as if each moment were their last.
 But ye, bright Flowers on frieze and architrave
 Survive, and once again the Pile stands fast:
 Calm as the Universe, from specular towers
 Of heaven contemplated by Spirits pure
 With mute astonishment, it stands sustained
 Through every part in symmetry, to endure,
 Unhurt, the assault of Time with all his hours,
 As the supreme Artificer ordained.
