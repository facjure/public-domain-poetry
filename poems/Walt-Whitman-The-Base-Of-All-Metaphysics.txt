title: The Base Of All Metaphysics
---

And now, gentlemen,
A word I give to remain in your memories and minds,
As base, and finale too, for all metaphysics.

(So, to the students, the old professor,
At the close of his crowded course.)

Having studied the new and antique, the Greek and Germanic systems,
Kant having studied and stated Fichte and Schelling and Hegel,
Stated the lore of Plato and Socrates, greater than Plato,
And greater than Socrates sought and stated Christ divine having studied long,
I see reminiscent to-day those Greek and Germanic systems,
See the philosophies all Christian churches and tenets see,
Yet underneath Socrates clearly see and underneath Christ the divine I see,
The dear love of man for his comrade the attraction of friend to friend,
Of the well-married husband and wife of children and parents,
Of city for city, and land for land.
