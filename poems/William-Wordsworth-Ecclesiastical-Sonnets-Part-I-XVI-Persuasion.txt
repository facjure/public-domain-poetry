 "Man's life is like a Sparrow, mighty King!
 "That, while at banquet with your Chiefs you sit
 "Housed near a blazing fire, is seen to flit
 "Safe from the wintry tempest. Fluttering,
 "Here did it enter; there, on hasty wing,
 "Flies out, and passes on from cold to cold;
 "But whence it came we know not, nor behold
 "Whither it goes. Even such, that transient Thing,
 "The human Soul; not utterly unknown
 "While in the Body lodged, her warm abode;
 "But from what world She came, what woe or weal
 "On her departure waits, no tongue hath shown;
 "This mystery if the Stranger can reveal,
 "His be a welcome cordially bestowed!"
