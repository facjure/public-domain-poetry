 They drift down the hall together;
 He smiles in her lifted eyes;
 Like waves of that mighty river,
 The strains of the "Danube" rise.
 They float on its rhythmic measure
 Like leaves on a summer-stream;
 And here, in this scene of pleasure,
 I bury my sweet, dead dream.

 Through the cloud of her dusky tresses,
 Like a star, shines out her face,
 And the form his strong arm presses
 Is sylph like in its grace.
 As a leaf on the bounding river
 Is lost in the seething sea,
 I know that forever and ever
 My dream is lost to me.

 And still the viols are playing
 That grand old wordless rhyme;
 And still those two ate swaying
 In perfect tune and time.
 If the great bassoons that mutter,
 If the clarinets that blow,
 Were given a voice to utter
 The secret things they know,

 Would the lists of the slam who slumber
 On the Danube's battle-plains
 The unknown hosts outnumber
 Who die 'neath the "Danube's" strains?
 Those fall where cannons rattle,
 'Mid the rain of shot and shell;
 But these, in a fiercer battle,
 Find death in the music's swell.

 With the river's roar of passion
 Is blended the dying groan;
 But here, in the halls of fashion,
 Hearts break, and make no moan.
 And the music, swelling and sweeping,
 Like the river, knows it all;
 But none are counting or keeping
 The lists of these who fall.
