 Yet more, round many a Convent's blazing fire
 Unhallowed threads of revelry are spun;
 There Venus sits disguised like a Nun,
 While Bacchus, clothed in semblance of a Friar,
 Pours out his choicest beverage high and higher
 Sparkling, until it cannot choose but run
 Over the bowl, whose silver lip hath won
 An instant kiss of masterful desire
 To stay the precious waste. Through every brain
 The domination of the sprightly juice
 Spreads high conceits to madding Fancy dear,
 Till the arched roof, with resolute abuse
 Of its grave echoes, swells a choral strain,
 Whose votive burthen is, "Our Kingdom's Here!"
