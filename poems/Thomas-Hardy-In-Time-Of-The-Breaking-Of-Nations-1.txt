I

Only a man harrowing clods
 In a slow silent walk
With an old horse that stumbles and nods
 Half asleep as they stalk.

II

Only thin smoke without flame
 From the heaps of couch-grass;
Yet this will go onward the same
 Though Dynasties pass.

III

Yonder a maid and her wight
 Come whispering by:
War's annals will cloud into night
 Ere their story die.

1915.
