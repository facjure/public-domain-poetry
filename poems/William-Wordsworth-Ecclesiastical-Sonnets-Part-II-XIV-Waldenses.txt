 Those had given earliest notice, as the lark
 Springs from the ground the morn to gratulate;
 Or rather rose the day to antedate,
 By striking out a solitary spark,
 When all the world with midnight gloom was dark.
 Then followed the Waldensian bands, whom Hate
 In vain endeavours to exterminate,
 Whom Obloquy pursues with hideous bark:
 But they desist not; and the sacred fire,
 Rekindled thus, from dens and savage woods
 Moves, handed on with never-ceasing care,
 Through courts, through camps, o'er limitary floods;
 Nor lacks this sea-girt Isle a timely share
 Of the new Flame, not suffered to expire.
