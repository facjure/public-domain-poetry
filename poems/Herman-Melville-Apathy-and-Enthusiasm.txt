 I

 O the clammy cold November,
 And the winter white and dead,
 And the terror dumb with stupor,
 And the sky a sheet of lead;
 And events that came resounding
 With the cry that All was lost,
 Like the thunder-cracks of massy ice
 In intensity of frost - 
 Bursting one upon another
 Through the horror of the calm.
 The paralysis of arm
 In the anguish of the heart;
 And the hollowness and dearth.
 The appealings of the mother
 To brother and to brother
 Not in hatred so to part - 
 And the fissure in the hearth
 Growing momently more wide.
 Then the glances 'tween the Fates,
 And the doubt on every side,
 And the patience under gloom
 In the stoniness that waits
 The finality of doom.


 II

 So the winter died despairing,
 And the weary weeks of Lent;
 And the ice-bound rivers melted,
 And the tomb of Faith was rent.
 O, the rising of the People
 Came with springing of the grass,
 They rebounded from dejection
 And Easter came to pass.
 And the young were all elation
 Hearing Sumter's cannon roar,
 And they thought how tame the Nation
 In the age that went before.
 And Michael seemed gigantical,
 The Arch-fiend but a dwarf;
 And at the towers of Erebus
 Our striplings flung the scoff.
 But the elders with foreboding
 Mourned the days forever o'er,
 And re called the forest proverb,
 The Iroquois' old saw:
 Grief to every graybeard
 When young Indians lead the war.
