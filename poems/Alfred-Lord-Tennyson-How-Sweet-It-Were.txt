title: How Sweet It Were
---

How sweet it were, hearing the downward stream,
With half-shut eyes ever to seem
Falling asleep in a half-dream!
To dream and dream, like yonder amber light,
Which will not leave the myrrh-bush on the height;
To hear each other�s whisper�d speech;
Eating the Lotos day by day,
To watch the crisping ripples on the beach,
And tender curving lines of creamy spray;
To lend our hearts and spirits wholly 
To the influence of mild-minded melancholy;
To muse and brood and live again in memory
With those old faces of our infancy
Heap�d over with a mound of grass,
Two handfuls of white dust, shut in an urn of brass!
