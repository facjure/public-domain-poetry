 Dermod O�Byrne of Omah town
 In his garden strode up and down;
 He pulled his beard, and he beat his breast;
 And this is his trouble and woe confessed:

 �The good-folk came in the night, and they
 Have stolen my bonny wean away;
 Have put in his place a changeling,
 A weashy, weakly, wizen thing!

 �From the speckled hen nine eggs I stole,
 And lighting a fire of a glowing coal,
 I fried the shells, and I spilt the yolk;
 But never a word the stranger spoke:

 �A bar of metal I heated red
 To frighten the fairy from its bed,
 To put in the place of this fretting wean
 My own bright beautiful boy again.

 �But my wife had hidden it in her arms,
 And cried �For shame!� on my fairy charms;
 She sobs, with the strange child on her breast:
 �I love the weak, wee babe the best!��

 To Dermod O�Byrne�s, the tale to hear,
 The neighbours came from far and near:
 Outside his gate, in the long boreen,
 They crossed themselves, and said between

 Their muttered prayers, �He has no luck!
 For sure the woman is fairy-struck,
 To leave her child a fairy guest,
 And love the weak, wee wean the best!�
