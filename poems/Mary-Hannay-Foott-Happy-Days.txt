title: Happy Days
---

A fringe of rushes, one green line
Upon a faded plain;
A silver streak of water-shine,
Above, tree-watchers twain.
It was our resting-place awhile,
And still, with backward gaze,
We say: ��Tis many a weary mile,
But there were happy days.�

And shall no ripple break the sand
Upon our farther way?
Or reedy ranks all knee-deep stand?
Or leafy tree-tops sway?
The gold of dawn is surely met
In sunset�s lavish blaze;
And, in horizons hidden yet,
There shall be happy days.
