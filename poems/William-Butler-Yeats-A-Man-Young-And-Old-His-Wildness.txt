title: A Man Young And Old:- His Wildness
---

O bid me mount and sail up there
Amid the cloudy wrack,
For peg and Meg and Paris� love
That had so straight a back,
Are gone away, and some that stay
Have changed their silk for sack.

Were I but there and none to hear
I�d have a peacock cry,
For that is natural to a man
That lives in memory,
Being all alone I�d nurse a stone
And sing it lullaby.
