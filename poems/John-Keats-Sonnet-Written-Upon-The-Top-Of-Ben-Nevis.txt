title: Sonnet: Written Upon The Top Of Ben Nevis
---

Read me a lesson, Muse, and speak it loud
Upon the top of Nevis, blind in mist!
I look into the chasms, and a shroud
Vapourous doth hide them, just so much I wist
Mankind do know of hell; I look o'erhead,
And there is sullen mist, even so much
Mankind can tell of heaven; mist is spread
Before the earth, beneath me, even such,
Even so vague is man's sight of himself!
Here are the craggy stones beneath my feet,
Thus much I know that, a poor witless elf,
I tread on them, that all my eye doth meet
Is mist and crag, not only on this height,
But in the world of thought and mental might!
