title: Evening Voluntaries - To Lucca Giordano

 Giordano, verily thy Pencil's skill
 Hath here portrayed with Nature's happiest grace
 The fair Endymion couched on Latmos-hill;
 And Dian gazing on the Shepherd's face
 In rapture, yet suspending her embrace,
 As not unconscious with what power the thrill
 Of her most timid touch his sleep would chase,
 And, with his sleep, that beauty calm and still.
 Oh may this work have found its last retreat
 Here in a Mountain-bard's secure abode,
 One to whom, yet a School-boy, Cynthia showed
 A face of love which he in love would greet,
 Fixed, by her smile, upon some rocky seat;
 Or lured along where greenwood paths he trod.
