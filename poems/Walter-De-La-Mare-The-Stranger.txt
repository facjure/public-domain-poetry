 In the woods as I did walk,
Dappled with the moon's beam,
 I did with a Stranger talk,
And his name was Dream.

 Spurred his heel, dark his cloak,
Shady-wide his bonnet's brim;
 His horse beneath a silvery oak
Grazed as I talked with him.

 Softly his breast-brooch burned and shone;
Hill and deep were in his eyes;
 One of his hands held mine, and one
The fruit that makes men wise.

 Wondrously strange was earth to see,
Flowers white as milk did gleam;
 Spread to Heaven the Assyrian Tree,
Over my head with Dream.

 Dews were still betwixt us twain;
Stars a trembling beauty shed;
 Yet - not a whisper comes again
Of the words he said.
