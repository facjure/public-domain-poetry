title: Sleep Now, O Sleep Now
---

Sleep now, O sleep now,
O you unquiet heart!
A voice crying �Sleep now�
Is heard in my heart.

The voice of the winter
Is heard at the door.
O sleep, for the winter
Is crying �Sleep no more.�

My kiss will give peace now
And quiet to your heart,
Sleep on in peace now,
O you unquiet heart!
