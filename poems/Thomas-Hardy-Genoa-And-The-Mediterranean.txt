(March, 1887)



 O epic-famed, god-haunted Central Sea,
 Heave careless of the deep wrong done to thee
When from Torino's track I saw thy face first flash on me.

 And multimarbled Genova the Proud,
 Gleam all unconscious how, wide-lipped, up-browed,
I first beheld thee clad - not as the Beauty but the Dowd.

 Out from a deep-delved way my vision lit
 On housebacks pink, green, ochreous - where a slit
Shoreward 'twixt row and row revealed the classic blue through it.

 And thereacross waved fishwives' high-hung smocks,
 Chrome kerchiefs, scarlet hose, darned underfrocks;
Since when too oft my dreams of thee, O Queen, that frippery mocks:

 Whereat I grieve, Superba! . . . Afterhours
 Within Palazzo Doria's orange bowers
Went far to mend these marrings of thy soul-subliming powers.

 But, Queen, such squalid undress none should see,
 Those dream-endangering eyewounds no more be
Where lovers first behold thy form in pilgrimage to thee.
