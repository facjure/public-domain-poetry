 "Ever exulting in thyself, on fire
To flaunt the purple of the Universe,
To strut and strut, and thy great part rehearse;
 Ever the slave of every proud desire;
 Come now a little down where sports thy sire;
Choose thy small better from thy abounding worse;
Prove thou thy lordship who hadst dust for nurse,
 And for thy swaddling the primeval mire!"

 Then stooped our Manhood nearer, deep and still,
As from earth's mountains an unvoyaged sea,
 Hushed my faint voice in its great peace until
It seemed but a bird's cry in eternity;
 And in its future loomed the undreamable,
And in its past slept simple men like me.
