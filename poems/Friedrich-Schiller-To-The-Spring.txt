 Welcome, gentle Stripling,
 Nature's darling thou!
 With thy basket full of blossoms,
 A happy welcome now!
 Aha! and thou returnest,
 Heartily we greet thee
 The loving and the fair one,
 Merrily we meet thee!
 Think'st thou of my maiden
 In thy heart of glee?

 I love her yet, the maiden
 And the maiden yet loves me!
 For the maiden, many a blossom
 I begged and not in vain!
 I came again a-begging,
 And thou thou givest again:
 Welcome, gentle Stripling,
 Nature's darling thou
 With thy basket full of blossoms,
 A happy welcome now!
