title: Alternative Song For The Severd Head In "The King Of The Great Clock Tower"
---

Saddle and ride, I heard a man say,
Out of Ben Bulben and Knocknarea,
i(What says the Clock in the Great Clock Tower?)
All those tragic characters ride
But turn from Rosses' crawling tide,
The meet's upon the mountain-side.
i(A slow low note and an iron bell.)
What brought them there so far from their home.
Cuchulain that fought night long with the foam,
i(What says the Clock in the Great Clock Tower?)
Niamh that rode on it; lad and lass
That sat so still and played at the chess?
What but heroic wantonness?
i(A slow low note and an iron bell.)
Aleel, his Countess; Hanrahan
That seemed but a wild wenching man;
i(What says the Clock in the Great Clock Tower?)
And all alone comes riding there
The King that could make his people stare,
Because he had feathers instead of hair.
i(A slow low note and an iron bell.)
