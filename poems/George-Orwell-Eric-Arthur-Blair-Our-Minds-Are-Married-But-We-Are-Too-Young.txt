title: Our Minds Are Married, But We Are Too Young
---

Our minds are married, but we are too young
For wedlock by the customs of this age
When parent homes pen each in separte cage
And only supper-earning songs are sung.

Times past, when medieval woods were green,
Babes were betrothed, and that betrothal brief.
Remember Romeo in love and grief
Those star-crossed lovers, Juliet was fourteen.

Times past, the caveman by his new-found fire
Rested beside his mate in woodsmoke�s scent.
By our own fireside we shall rest content
Fifty years hence keep troth with hearts desire.

We shall remember, when our hair is white,
These clouded days revealed in radiant light.
