 The bindweed roots pierce down
 Deeper than men do lie,
 Laid in their dark-shut graves
 Their slumbering kinsmen by.

 Yet what frail thin-spun flowers
 She casts into the air,
 To breathe the sunshine, and
 To leave her fragrance there.

 But when the sweet moon comes,
 Showering her silver down,
 Half-wreath�d in faint sleep,
 They droop where they have blown.

 So all the grass is set,
 Beneath her trembling ray,
 With buds that have been flowers,
 Brimmed with reflected day.
