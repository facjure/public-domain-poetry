title: Epitaphs VI. Destined To War From Very Infancy
---

 Destined to war from very infancy
 Was I, Roberto Dati, and I took
 In Malta the white symbol of the Cross:
 Nor in life's vigorous season did I shun
 Hazard or toil; among the sands was seen
 Of Libya; and not seldom, on the banks
 Of wide Hungarian Danube, 'twas my lot
 To hear the sanguinary trumpet sounded.
 So lived I, and repined not at such fate:
 This only grieves me, for it seems a wrong,
 That stripped of arms I to my end am brought
 On the soft down of my paternal home.
 Yet haply Arno shall be spared all cause
 To blush for me. Thou, loiter not nor halt
 In thy appointed way, and bear in mind
 How fleeting and how frail is human life!
