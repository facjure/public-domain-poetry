 Even so for me a Vision sanctified
 The sway of Death; long ere mine eyes had seen
 Thy countenance, the still rapture of thy mien
 When thou, dear Sister! wert become Death's Bride:
 No trace of pain or languor could abide
 That change: age on thy brow was smoothed thy cold
 Wan cheek at once was privileged to unfold
 A loveliness to living youth denied.
 Oh! if within me hope should e'er decline,
 The lamp of faith, lost Friend! too faintly burn;
 Then may that heaven-revealing smile of thine,
 The bright assurance, visibly return:
 And let my spirit in that power divine
 Rejoice, as, through that power, it ceased to mourn.
