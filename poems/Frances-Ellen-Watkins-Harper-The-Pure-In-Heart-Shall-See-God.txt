title: The Pure In Heart Shall See God.
---

 They shall see Him in the crimson flush
 Of morning's early light,
 In the drapery of sunset,
 Around the couch of night.


 When the clouds drop down their fatness,
 In late and early rain,
 They shall see His glorious footprints
 On valley, hill and plain.

 They shall see Him when the cyclone
 Breathes terror through the land;
 They shall see Him 'mid the murmurs
 Of zephyrs soft and bland.

 They shall see Him when the lips of health,
 Breath vigor through each nerve,
 When pestilence clasps hands with death,
 His purposes to serve.

 They shall see Him when the trembling earth
 Is rocking to and fro;
 They shall see Him in the order
 The seasons come and go.

 They shall see Him when the storms of war
 Sweep wildly through the land;
 When peace descends like gentle dew
 They still shall see His hand.

 They shall see Him in the city
 Of gems and pearls of light,
 They shall see Him in his beauty,
 And walk with Him in white.

 To living founts their feet shall tend,
 And Christ shall be their guide,
 Beloved of God, their rest shall be
 In safety by His side.
