 I rose while yet the cattle, heat-opprest,
 Crowded together under rustling trees
 Brushed by the current of the water-breeze;
 And for 'their' sakes, and love of all that rest,
 On Duddon's margin, in the sheltering nest;
 For all the startled scaly tribes that slink
 Into his coverts, and each fearless link
 Of dancing insects forged upon his breast;
 For these, and hopes and recollections worn
 Close to the vital seat of human clay;
 Glad meetings, tender partings, that upstay
 The drooping mind of absence, by vows sworn
 In his pure presence near the trysting thorn
 I thanked the Leader of my onward way.
