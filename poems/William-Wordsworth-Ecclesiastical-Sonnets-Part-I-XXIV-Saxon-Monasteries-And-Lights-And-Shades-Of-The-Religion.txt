 By such examples moved to unbought pains,
 The people work like congregated bees;
 Eager to build the quiet Fortresses
 Where Piety, as they believe, obtains
 From Heaven a 'general' blessing; timely rains
 Or needful sunshine; prosperous enterprise,
 Justice and peace: bold faith! yet also rise
 The sacred Structures for less doubtful gains.
 The Sensual think with reverence of the palms
 Which the chaste Votaries seek, beyond the grave
 If penance be redeemable, thence alms
 Flow to the poor, and freedom to the slave;
 And if full oft the Sanctuary save
 Lives black with guilt, ferocity it calms.
