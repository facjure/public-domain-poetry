title: Lucy I
---

Strange fits of passion have I known:
And I will dare to tell,
But in the lover�s ear alone,
What once to me befell.

When she I loved look�d every day
Fresh as a rose in June,
I to her cottage bent my way,
Beneath an evening moon.

Upon the moon I fix�d my eye,
All over the wide lea;
With quickening pace my horse drew nigh
Those paths so dear to me.

And now we reach�d the orchard-plot;
And, as we climb�d the hill,
The sinking moon to Lucy�s cot
Came near and nearer still.

In one of those sweet dreams I slept,
Kind Nature�s gentlest boon!
And all the while my eyes I kept
On the descending moon.

My horse moved on; hoof after hoof
He raised, and never stopp�d:
When down behind the cottage roof,
At once, the bright moon dropp�d.

What fond and wayward thoughts will slide
Into a lover�s head!
�O mercy!� to myself I cried,
�If Lucy should be dead!�
