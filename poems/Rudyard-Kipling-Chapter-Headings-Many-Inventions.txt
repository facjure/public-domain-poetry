�Less you want your toes trod off you�d better get back at once,
For the bullocks are walking two by two,
The byles are walking two by two,
And the elephants bring the guns.
Ho! Yuss!
Great, big, long, black, forty-pounder guns.
Jiggery jolty to and fro,
Each as big as a launch in tow, 
Blind, dumb, broad-breeched, beggars o� battering-guns.
My Lord the Elephant.
