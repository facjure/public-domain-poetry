 Child of the clouds! remote from every taint
 Of sordid industry thy lot is cast;
 Thine are the honours of the lofty waste
 Not seldom, when with heat the valleys faint,
 Thy handmaid Frost with spangled tissue quaint
 Thy cradle decks; to chant thy birth, thou hast
 No meaner Poet than the whistling Blast,
 And Desolation is thy Patron-saint!
 She guards thee, ruthless Power! who would not spare
 Those mighty forests, once the bison's screen,
 Where stalked the huge deer to his shaggy lair
 Through paths and alleys roofed with darkest green;
 Thousands of years before the silent air
 Was pierced by whizzing shaft of hunter keen!
