Ring your sweet bells; but let them be farewells
 To the green-vista'd gladness of the past
That changed us into soldiers; swing your bells
 To a joyful chime; but let it be the last.

What means this metal in windy belfries hung
 When guns are all our need? Dissolve these bells
Whose tones are tuned for peace: with martial tongue
 Let them cry doom and storm the sun with shells.

Bells are like fierce-browed prelates who proclaim
 That "if our Lord returned He'd fight for us."
So let our bells and bishops do the same,
 Shoulder to shoulder with the motor bus.
