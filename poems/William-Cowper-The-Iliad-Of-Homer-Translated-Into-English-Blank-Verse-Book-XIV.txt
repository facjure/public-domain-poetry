 Argument Of The Twenty-Fourth Book.


Priam, by command of Jupiter, and under conduct of Mercury, seeks Achilles in his tent, who admonished previously by Thetis, consents to accept ransom for the body of Hector. Hector is mourned, and the manner of his funeral, circumstantially described, concludes the poem.



 The games all closed, the people went dispersed
 Each to his ship; they, mindful of repast,
 And to enjoy repose; but other thoughts
 Achilles' mind employ'd: he still deplored
 With tears his loved Patroclus, nor the force
 Felt of all-conquering sleep, but turn'd and turn'd
 Restless from side to side, mourning the loss
 Of such a friend, so manly, and so brave.
 Their fellowship in toil; their hardships oft
 Sustain'd in fight laborious, or o'ercome
 With difficulty on the perilous deep--
 Remembrance busily retracing themes
 Like these, drew down his cheeks continual tears.
 Now on his side he lay, now lay supine,
 Now prone, then starting from his couch he roam'd
 Forlorn the beach, nor did the rising morn
 On seas and shores escape his watchful eye,
 But joining to his chariot his swift steeds,
 He fasten'd Hector to be dragg'd behind.
 Around the tomb of Menoetiades
 Him thrice he dragg'd; then rested in his tent,
 Leaving him at his length stretch'd in the dust.
 Meantime Apollo with compassion touch'd
 Even of the lifeless Hector, from all taint
 Saved him, and with the golden �gis broad
 Covering, preserved him, although dragg'd, untorn.
 While he, indulging thus his wrath, disgraced
 Brave Hector, the immortals at that sight
 With pity moved, exhorted Mercury
 The watchful Argicide, to steal him thence.
 That counsel pleased the rest, but neither pleased
 Juno, nor Neptune, nor the blue-eyed maid.
 They still, as at the first, held fast their hate
 Of sacred Troy, detested Priam still,
 And still his people, mindful of the crime
 Of Paris, who when to his rural hut
 They came, those Goddesses affronting,[1] praise
 And admiration gave to her alone
 Who with vile lusts his preference repaid.
 But when the twelfth ensuing morn arose,
 Apollo, then, the immortals thus address'd.
 Ye Gods, your dealings now injurious seem
 And cruel. Was not Hector wont to burn
 Thighs of fat goats and bullocks at your shrines?
 Whom now, though dead, ye cannot yet endure
 To rescue, that Andromache once more
 Might view him, his own mother, his own son,
 His father and the people, who would soon
 Yield him his just demand, a funeral fire.
 But, oh ye Gods! your pleasure is alone
 To please Achilles, that pernicious chief,
 Who neither right regards, nor owns a mind
 That can relent, but as the lion, urged
 By his own dauntless heart and savage force,
 Invades without remorse the rights of man,
 That he may banquet on his herds and flocks,
 So Peleus' son all pity from his breast
 Hath driven, and shame, man's blessing or his curse.[2]
 For whosoever hath a loss sustain'd
 Still dearer, whether of his brother born
 From the same womb, or even of his son,
 When he hath once bewail'd him, weeps no more,
 For fate itself gives man a patient mind.
 Yet Peleus' son, not so contented, slays
 Illustrious Hector first, then drags his corse
 In cruel triumph at his chariot-wheels
 Around Patroclus' tomb; but neither well
 He acts, nor honorably to himself,
 Who may, perchance, brave though he be, incur
 Our anger, while to gratify revenge
 He pours dishonor thus on senseless clay.
 To whom, incensed, Juno white-arm'd replied.
 And be it so; stand fast this word of thine,
 God of the silver bow! if ye account
 Only such honor to Achilles due
 As Hector claims; but Hector was by birth
 Mere man, and suckled at a woman's breast.
 Not such Achilles; him a Goddess bore,
 Whom I myself nourish'd, and on my lap
 Fondled, and in due time to Peleus gave
 In marriage, to a chief beloved in heaven
 Peculiarly; ye were yourselves, ye Gods!
 Partakers of the nuptial feast, and thou
 Wast present also with thine harp in hand,
 Thou comrade of the vile! thou faithless ever!
 Then answer thus cloud-gatherer Jove return'd.
 Juno, forbear. Indulge not always wrath
 Against the Gods. They shall not share alike,
 And in the same proportion our regards.
 Yet even Hector was the man in Troy
 Most favor'd by the Gods, and him no less
 I also loved, for punctual were his gifts
 To us; mine altar never miss'd from him
 Libation, or the steam of sacrifice,
 The meed allotted to us from of old.
 But steal him not, since by Achilles' eye
 Unseen ye cannot, who both day and night
 Watches[3] him, as a mother tends her son.
 But call ye Thetis hither, I would give
 The Goddess counsel, that, at Priam's hands
 Accepting gifts, Achilles loose the dead.
 He ceased. Then Iris tempest-wing'd arose.
 Samos between, and Imbrus rock-begirt,
 She plunged into the gloomy flood; loud groan'd
 The briny pool, while sudden down she rush'd,
 As sinks the bull's[4] horn with its leaden weight,
 Death bearing to the raveners of the deep.
 Within her vaulted cave Thetis she found
 By every nymph of Ocean round about
 Encompass'd; she, amid them all, the fate
 Wept of her noble son ordain'd to death
 At fertile Troy, from Phthia far remote.
 Then, Iris, drawing near, her thus address'd.
 Arise, O Thetis! Jove, the author dread
 Of everlasting counsels, calls for thee.
 To whom the Goddess of the silver feet.
 Why calls the mighty Thunderer me? I fear,
 Oppress'd with countless sorrows as I am,
 To mingle with the Gods. Yet I obey--
 No word of his can prove an empty sound.
 So saying, the Goddess took her sable veil
 (Eye ne'er beheld a darker) and began
 Her progress, by the storm-wing'd Iris led.
 On either hand the billows open'd wide
 A pass before them; they, ascending soon
 The shore, updarted swift into the skies.
 They found loud-voiced Saturnian Jove around
 Environ'd by the ever-blessed Gods
 Convened in full assembly; she beside
 Her Father Jove (Pallas retiring) sat.
 Then, Juno, with consolatory speech,
 Presented to her hand a golden cup,
 Of which she drank, then gave it back again,
 And thus the sire of Gods and men began.
 Goddess of ocean, Thetis! thou hast sought
 Olympus, bearing in thy bosom grief
 Never to be assuaged, as well I know.
 Yet shalt thou learn, afflicted as thou art,
 Why I have summon'd thee. Nine days the Gods,
 Concerning Hector's body and thy own
 Brave city-spoiler son, have held dispute,
 And some have urged ofttimes the Argicide
 Keen-sighted Mercury, to steal the dead.
 But I forbade it for Achilles' sake,
 Whom I exalt, the better to insure
 Thy reverence and thy friendship evermore.
 Haste, therefore, seek thy son, and tell him thus,
 The Gods resent it, say (but most of all
 Myself am angry) that he still detains
 Amid his fleet, through fury of revenge,
 Unransom'd Hector; so shall he, at length,
 Through fear of me, perchance, release the slain.
 Myself to generous Priam will, the while,
 Send Iris, who shall bid him to the fleet
 Of Greece, such ransom bearing as may soothe
 Achilles, for redemption of his son.
 So spake the God, nor Thetis not complied.
 Descending swift from the Olympian heights
 She reach'd Achilles' tent. Him there she found
 Groaning disconsolate, while others ran
 To and fro, occupied around a sheep
 New-slaughter'd, large, and of exuberant fleece.
 She, sitting close beside him, softly strok'd
 His cheek, and thus, affectionate, began.
 How long, my son! sorrowing and mourning here,
 Wilt thou consume thy soul, nor give one thought
 Either to food or love? Yet love is good,
 And woman grief's best cure; for length of days
 Is not thy doom, but, even now, thy death
 And ruthless destiny are on the wing.
 Mark me,--I come a lieger sent from Jove.
 The Gods, he saith, resent it, but himself
 More deeply than the rest, that thou detain'st
 Amid thy fleet, through fury of revenge,
 Unransom'd Hector. Be advised, accept
 Ransom, and to his friends resign the dead.
 To whom Achilles, swiftest of the swift.
 Come then the ransomer, and take him hence;
 If Jove himself command it,--be it so.
 So they, among the ships, conferring sat
 On various themes, the Goddess and her son;
 Meantime Saturnian Jove commanded down
 His swift ambassadress to sacred Troy.
 Hence, rapid Iris! leave the Olympian heights.
 And, finding noble Priam, bid him haste
 Into Achaia's fleet, bearing such gifts
 As may assuage Achilles, and prevail
 To liberate the body of his son.
 Alone, he must; no Trojan of them all
 May company the senior thither, save
 An ancient herald to direct his mules
 And his wheel'd litter, and to bring the dead
 Back into Ilium, whom Achilles slew.
 Let neither fear of death nor other fear
 Trouble him aught, so safe a guard and sure
 We give him; Mercury shall be his guide
 Into Achilles' presence in his tent.
 Nor will himself Achilles slay him there,
 Or even permit his death, but will forbid
 All violence; for he is not unwise
 Nor heedless, no--nor wilful to offend,
 But will his suppliant with much grace receive.[5]
 He ceased; then Iris tempest-wing'd arose,
 Jove's messenger, and, at the gates arrived
 Of Priam, wo and wailing found within.
 Around their father, in the hall, his sons
 Their robes with tears water'd, while them amidst
 The hoary King sat mantled, muffled close,
 And on his venerable head and neck
 Much dust was spread, which, rolling on the earth,
 He had shower'd on them with unsparing hands.
 The palace echoed to his daughters' cries,
 And to the cries of matrons calling fresh
 Into remembrance many a valiant chief
 Now stretch'd in dust, by Argive hands destroy'd.
 The messenger of Jove at Priam's side
 Standing, with whisper'd accents low his ear
 Saluted, but he trembled at the sound.
 Courage, Dardanian Priam! fear thou nought;
 To thee no prophetess of ill, I come;
 But with kind purpose: Jove's ambassadress
 Am I, who though remote, yet entertains
 Much pity, and much tender care for thee.
 Olympian Jove commands thee to redeem
 The noble Hector, with an offering large
 Of gifts that may Achilles' wrath appease.
 Alone, thou must; no Trojan of them all
 Hath leave to attend thy journey thither, save
 An ancient herald to direct thy mules
 And thy wheel'd litter, and to bring the dead
 Back into Ilium, whom Achilles slew.
 Let neither fear of death nor other fear
 Trouble thee aught, so safe a guard and sure
 He gives thee; Mercury shall be thy guide
 Even to Achilles' presence in his tent.
 Nor will himself Achilles slay thee there,
 Or even permit thy death, but will forbid
 All violence; for he is not unwise
 Nor heedless, no--nor wilful to offend,
 But will his suppliant with much grace receive.
 So spake the swift ambassadress, and went.
 Then, calling to his sons, he bade them bring
 His litter forth, and bind the coffer on,
 While to his fragrant chamber he repair'd
 Himself, with cedar lined and lofty-roof'd,
 A treasury of wonders into which
 The Queen he summon'd, whom he thus bespake.
 Hecuba! the ambassadress of Jove
 Hath come, who bids me to the Grecian fleet,
 Bearing such presents thither as may soothe
 Achilles, for redemption of my son.
 But say, what seems this enterprise to thee?
 Myself am much inclined to it, I feel
 My courage prompting me amain toward
 The fleet, and into the Achaian camp.
 Then wept the Queen aloud, and thus replied.
 Ah! whither is thy wisdom fled, for which
 Both strangers once, and Trojans honor'd thee?
 How canst thou wish to penetrate alone
 The Grecian fleet, and to appear before
 His face, by whom so many valiant sons
 Of thine have fallen? Thou hast an iron heart!
 For should that savage man and faithless once
 Seize and discover thee, no pity expect
 Or reverence at his hands. Come--let us weep
 Together, here sequester'd; for the thread
 Spun for him by his destiny severe
 When he was born, ordain'd our son remote
 From us his parents to be food for hounds
 In that chief's tent. Oh! clinging to his side,
 How I could tear him with my teeth! His deeds,
 Disgraceful to my son, then should not want
 Retaliation; for he slew not him
 Skulking, but standing boldly for the wives,
 The daughters fair, and citizens of Troy,
 Guiltless of flight,[6] and of the wish to fly.
 Whom godlike Priam answer'd, ancient King.
 Impede me not who willing am to go,
 Nor be, thyself, a bird of ominous note
 To terrify me under my own roof,
 For thou shalt not prevail. Had mortal man
 Enjoin'd me this attempt, prophet, or priest,
 Or soothsayer, I had pronounced him false
 And fear'd it but the more. But, since I saw
 The Goddess with these eyes, and heard, myself,
 The voice divine, I go; that word shall stand;
 And, if my doom be in the fleet of Greece
 To perish, be it so; Achilles' arm
 Shall give me speedy death, and I shall die
 Folding my son, and satisfied with tears.
 So saying, he open'd wide the elegant lids
 Of numerous chests, whence mantles twelve he took
 Of texture beautiful; twelve single cloaks;
 As many carpets, with as many robes,
 To which he added vests, an equal store.
 He also took ten talents forth of gold,
 All weigh'd, two splendid tripods, caldrons four,
 And after these a cup of matchless worth
 Given to him when ambassador in Thrace;
 A noble gift, which yet the hoary King
 Spared not, such fervor of desire he felt
 To loose his son. Then from his portico,
 With angry taunts he drove the gather'd crowds.
 Away! away! ye dregs of earth, away!
 Ye shame of human kind! Have ye no griefs
 At home, that ye come hither troubling me?
 Deem ye it little that Saturnian Jove
 Afflicts me thus, and of my very best,
 Best boy deprives me? Ah! ye shall be taught
 Yourselves that loss, far easier to be slain
 By the Achaians now, since he is dead.
 But I, ere yet the city I behold
 Taken and pillaged, with these aged eyes,
 Shall find safe hiding in the shades below.
 He said, and chased them with his staff; they left
 In haste the doors, by the old King expell'd.
 Then, chiding them aloud, his sons he call'd,
 Helenus, Paris, noble Agathon,
 Pammon, Antiphonus, and bold in fight
 Polites, Dios of illustrious fame,
 Hippotho�s and Deiphobus--all nine
 He call'd, thus issuing, angry, his commands.
 Quick! quick! ye slothful in your father's cause,
 Ye worthless brood! would that in Hector's stead
 Ye all had perish'd in the fleet of Greece!
 Oh altogether wretched! in all Troy
 No man had sons to boast valiant as mine,
 And I have lost them all. Mestor is gone
 The godlike, Troilus the steed-renown'd,
 And Hector, who with other men compared
 Seem'd a Divinity, whom none had deem'd
 From mortal man derived, but from a God.
 These Mars hath taken, and hath left me none
 But scandals of my house, void of all truth,
 Dancers, exact step-measurers,[7] a band
 Of public robbers, thieves of kids and lambs.
 Will ye not bring my litter to the gate
 This moment, and with all this package quick
 Charge it, that we may hence without delay?
 He said, and by his chiding awed, his sons
 Drew forth the royal litter, neat, new-built,
 And following swift the draught, on which they bound
 The coffer; next, they lower'd from the wall
 The sculptured boxen yoke with its two rings;[8]
 And with the yoke its furniture, in length
 Nine cubits; this to the extremest end
 Adjusting of the pole, they cast the ring
 Over the ring-bolt; then, thrice through the yoke
 They drew the brace on both sides, made it fast
 With even knots, and tuck'd[9] the dangling ends.
 Producing, next, the glorious ransom-price
 Of Hector's body, on the litter's floor
 They heap'd it all, then yoked the sturdy mules,
 A gift illustrious by the Mysians erst
 Conferr'd on Priam; to the chariot, last,
 They led forth Priam's steeds, which the old King
 (In person serving them) with freshest corn
 Constant supplied; meantime, himself within
 The palace, and his herald, were employ'd
 Girding[10] themselves, to go; wise each and good.
 And now came mournful Hecuba, with wine
 Delicious charged, which in a golden cup
 She brought, that not without libation due
 First made, they might depart. Before the steeds
 Her steps she stay'd, and Priam thus address'd.
 Take this, and to the Sire of all perform
 Libation, praying him a safe return
 From hostile hands, since thou art urged to seek
 The Grecian camp, though not by my desire.
 Pray also to Id�an Jove cloud-girt,
 Who oversees all Ilium, that he send
 His messenger or ere thou go, the bird
 His favorite most, surpassing all in strength,
 At thy right hand; him seeing, thou shalt tend
 With better hope toward the fleet of Greece.
 But should loud-thundering Jove his lieger swift
 Withhold, from me far be it to advise
 This journey, howsoe'er thou wish to go.
 To whom the godlike Priam thus replied.
 This exhortation will I not refuse,
 O Queen! for, lifting to the Gods his hands
 In prayer for their compassion, none can err.
 So saying, he bade the maiden o'er the rest,
 Chief in authority, pour on his hands
 Pure water, for the maiden at his side
 With ewer charged and laver, stood prepared.
 He laved his hands; then, taking from the Queen
 The goblet, in his middle area stood
 Pouring libation with his eyes upturn'd
 Heaven-ward devout, and thus his prayer preferr'd.
 Jove, great and glorious above all, who rulest,
 On Ida's summit seated, all below!
 Grant me arrived within Achilles' tent
 Kindness to meet and pity, and oh send
 Thy messenger or ere I go, the bird
 Thy favorite most, surpassing all in strength,
 At my right hand, which seeing, I shall tend
 With better hope toward the fleet of Greece.
 He ended, at whose prayer, incontinent,
 Jove sent his eagle, surest of all signs,
 The black-plumed bird voracious, Morphnos[11] named,
 And Percnos.[11] Wide as the well-guarded door
 Of some rich potentate his vans he spread
 On either side; they saw him on the right,
 Skimming the towers of Troy; glad they beheld
 That omen, and all felt their hearts consoled.
 Delay'd not then the hoary King, but quick
 Ascending to his seat, his coursers urged
 Through vestibule and sounding porch abroad.
 The four-wheel'd litter led, drawn by the mules
 Which sage Id�us managed, behind whom
 Went Priam, plying with the scourge his steeds
 Continual through the town, while all his friends,
 Following their sovereign with dejected hearts,
 Lamented him as going to his death.
 But when from Ilium's gate into the plain
 They had descended, then the sons-in-law
 Of Priam, and his sons, to Troy return'd.
 Nor they, now traversing the plain, the note
 Escaped of Jove the Thunderer; he beheld
 Compassionate the venerable King,
 And thus his own son Mercury bespake.
 Mercury! (for above all others thou
 Delightest to associate with mankind
 Familiar, whom thou wilt winning with ease
 To converse free) go thou, and so conduct
 Priam into the Grecian camp, that none
 Of all the numerous Dana� may see
 Or mark him, till he reach Achilles' tent.
 He spake, nor the ambassador of heaven
 The Argicide delay'd, but bound in haste
 His undecaying sandals to his feet,
 Golden, divine, which waft him o'er the floods
 Swift as the wind, and o'er the boundless earth.
 He took his rod with which he charms to sleep
 All eyes, and theirs who sleep opens again.
 Arm'd with that rod, forth flew the Argicide.
 At Ilium and the Hellespontic shores
 Arriving sudden, a king's son he seem'd,
 Now clothing first his ruddy cheek with down,
 Which is youth's loveliest season; so disguised,
 His progress he began. They now (the tomb
 Magnificent of Ilus past) beside
 The river stay'd the mules and steeds to drink,
 For twilight dimm'd the fields. Id�us first
 Perceived him near, and Priam thus bespake.
 Think, son of Dardanus! for we have need
 Of our best thought. I see a warrior. Now,
 Now we shall die; I know it. Turn we quick
 Our steeds to flight; or let us clasp his knees
 And his compassion suppliant essay.
 Terror and consternation at that sound
 The mind of Priam felt; erect the hair
 Bristled his limbs, and with amaze he stood
 Motionless. But the God, meantime, approach'd,
 And, seizing ancient Priam's hand, inquired.
 Whither, my father! in the dewy night
 Drivest thou thy mules and steeds, while others sleep?
 And fear'st thou not the fiery host of Greece,
 Thy foes implacable, so nigh at hand?
 Of whom should any, through the shadow dun
 Of flitting night, discern thee bearing forth
 So rich a charge, then what wouldst thou expect?
 Thou art not young thyself, nor with the aid
 Of this thine ancient servant, strong enough
 Force to repulse, should any threaten force.
 But injury fear none or harm from me;
 I rather much from harm by other hands
 Would save thee, thou resemblest so my sire.
 Whom answer'd godlike Priam, hoar with age.
 My son! well spoken. Thou hast judged aright.
 Yet even me some Deity protects
 Thus far; to whom I owe it that I meet
 So seasonably one like thee, in form
 So admirable, and in mind discreet
 As thou art beautiful. Blest parents, thine!
 To whom the messenger of heaven again,
 The Argicide. Oh ancient and revered!
 Thou hast well spoken all. Yet this declare,
 And with sincerity; bear'st thou away
 Into some foreign country, for the sake
 Of safer custody, this precious charge?
 Or, urged by fear, forsake ye all alike
 Troy's sacred towers! since he whom thou hast lost,
 Thy noble son, was of excelling worth
 In arms, and nought inferior to the Greeks.
 Then thus the godlike Priam, hoary King.
 But tell me first who Thou art, and from whom
 Descended, loveliest youth! who hast the fate
 So well of my unhappy son rehearsed?
 To whom the herald Mercury replied.
 Thy questions, venerable sire! proposed
 Concerning noble Hector, are design'd
 To prove me. Him, not seldom, with these eyes
 In man-ennobling fight I have beheld
 Most active; saw him when he thinn'd the Greeks
 With his sharp spear, and drove them to the ships.
 Amazed we stood to notice him; for us,
 Incensed against the ruler of our host,
 Achilles suffer'd not to share the fight.
 I serve Achilles; the same gallant bark
 Brought us, and of the Myrmidons am I,
 Son of Polyctor; wealthy is my sire,
 And such in years as thou; six sons he hath,
 Beside myself the seventh, and (the lots cast
 Among us all) mine sent me to the wars.
 That I have left the ships, seeking the plain,
 The cause is this; the Greeks, at break of day,
 Will compass, arm'd, the city, for they loathe
 To sit inactive, neither can the chiefs
 Restrain the hot impatience of the host.
 Then godlike Priam answer thus return'd.
 If of the band thou be of Peleus' son,
 Achilles, tell me undisguised the truth.
 My son, subsists he still, or hath thy chief
 Limb after limb given him to his dogs?
 Him answer'd then the herald of the skies.
 Oh venerable sir! him neither dogs
 Have eaten yet, nor fowls, but at the ships
 His body, and within Achilles' tent
 Neglected lies. Twelve days he so hath lain;
 Yet neither worm which diets on the brave
 In battle fallen, hath eaten him, or taint
 Invaded. He around Patroclus' tomb
 Drags him indeed pitiless, oft as day
 Reddens the east, yet safe from blemish still
 His corse remains. Thou wouldst, thyself, admire
 Seeing how fresh the dew-drops, as he lies,
 Rest on him, and his blood is cleansed away
 That not a stain is left. Even his wounds
 (For many a wound they gave him) all are closed,
 Such care the blessed Gods have of thy son,
 Dead as he is, whom living much they loved.
 So he; then, glad, the ancient King replied.
 Good is it, oh my son! to yield the Gods
 Their just demands. My boy, while yet he lived,
 Lived not unmindful of the worship due
 To the Olympian powers, who, therefore, him
 Remember, even in the bands of death.
 Come then--this beauteous cup take at my hand--
 Be thou my guard, and, if the Gods permit,
 My guide, till to Achilles' tent I come.
 Whom answer'd then the messenger of heaven.
 Sir! thou perceivest me young, and art disposed
 To try my virtue; but it shall not fail.
 Thou bidd'st me at thine hand a gift accept,
 Whereof Achilles knows not; but I fear
 Achilles, and on no account should dare
 Defraud him, lest some evil find me next.
 But thee I would with pleasure hence conduct
 Even to glorious Argos, over sea
 Or over land, nor any, through contempt
 Of such a guard, should dare to do thee wrong.
 So Mercury, and to the chariot seat
 Upspringing, seized at once the lash and reins,
 And with fresh vigor mules and steeds inspired.
 Arriving at the foss and towers, they found
 The guard preparing now their evening cheer,
 All whom the Argicide with sudden sleep
 Oppress'd, then oped the gates, thrust back the bars,
 And introduced, with all his litter-load
 Of costly gifts, the venerable King.
 But when they reached the tent for Peleus' son
 Raised by the Myrmidons (with trunks of pine
 They built it, lopping smooth the boughs away,
 Then spread with shaggy mowings of the mead
 Its lofty roof, and with a spacious court
 Surrounded it, all fenced with driven stakes;
 One bar alone of pine secured the door,
 Which ask'd three Grecians with united force
 To thrust it to its place, and three again
 To thrust it back, although Achilles oft
 Would heave it to the door himself alone;)
 Then Hermes, benefactor of mankind,
 That bar displacing for the King of Troy,
 Gave entrance to himself and to his gifts
 For Peleus' son design'd, and from the seat
 Alighting, thus his speech to Priam turn'd.
 Oh ancient Priam! an immortal God
 Attends thee; I am Hermes, by command
 Of Jove my father thy appointed guide.
 But I return. I will not, entering here,
 Stand in Achilles' sight; immortal Powers
 May not so unreservedly indulge
 Creatures of mortal kind. But enter thou,
 Embrace his knees, and by his father both
 And by his Goddess mother sue to him,
 And by his son, that his whole heart may melt.
 So Hermes spake, and to the skies again
 Ascended. Then leap'd Priam to the ground,
 Leaving Id�us; he, the mules and steeds
 Watch'd, while the ancient King into the tent
 Proceeded of Achilles dear to Jove.
 Him there he found, and sitting found apart
 His fellow-warriors, of whom two alone
 Served at his side, Alcimus, branch of Mars
 And brave Automedon; he had himself
 Supp'd newly, and the board stood unremoved.
 Unseen of all huge Priam enter'd, stood
 Near to Achilles, clasp'd his knees, and kiss'd
 Those terrible and homicidal hands
 That had destroy'd so many of his sons.
 As when a fugitive for blood the house
 Of some chief enters in a foreign land,
 All gaze, astonish'd at the sudden guest,
 So gazed Achilles seeing Priam there,
 And so stood all astonish'd, each his eyes
 In silence fastening on his fellow's face.
 But Priam kneel'd, and suppliant thus began.
 Think, oh Achilles, semblance of the Gods!
 On thy own father full of days like me,
 And trembling on the gloomy verge of life.[12]
 Some neighbor chief, it may be, even now
 Oppresses him, and there is none at hand,
 No friend to suocor him in his distress.
 Yet, doubtless, hearing that Achilles lives,
 He still rejoices, hoping, day by day,
 That one day he shall see the face again
 Of his own son from distant Troy return'd.
 But me no comfort cheers, whose bravest sons,
 So late the flower of Ilium, all are slain.
 When Greece came hither, I had fifty sons;
 Nineteen were children of one bed, the rest
 Born of my concubines. A numerous house!
 But fiery Mars hath thinn'd it. One I had,
 One, more than all my sons the strength of Troy,
 Whom standing for his country thou hast slain--
 Hector--his body to redeem I come
 Into Achaia's fleet, bringing, myself,
 Ransom inestimable to thy tent.
 Reverence the Gods, Achilles! recollect
 Thy father; for his sake compassion show
 To me more pitiable still, who draw
 Home to my lips (humiliation yet
 Unseen on earth) his hand who slew my son.
 So saying, he waken'd in his soul regret
 Of his own sire; softly he placed his hand
 On Priam's hand, and push'd him gently away.
 Remembrance melted both. Rolling before
 Achilles' feet, Priam his son deplored
 Wide-slaughtering Hector, and Achilles wept
 By turns his father, and by turns his friend
 Patroclus; sounds of sorrow fill'd the tent.
 But when, at length satiate, Achilles felt
 His heart from grief, and all his frame relieved,
 Upstarting from his seat, with pity moved
 Of Priam's silver locks and silver beard,
 He raised the ancient father by his hand,
 Whom in wing'd accents kind he thus bespake.
 Wretched indeed! ah what must thou have felt!
 How hast thou dared to seek alone the fleet
 Of the Achaians, and his face by whom
 So many of thy valiant sons have fallen?
 Thou hast a heart of iron, terror-proof.
 Come--sit beside me--let us, if we may,
 Great mourners both, bid sorrow sleep awhile.
 There is no profit of our sighs and tears;
 For thus, exempt from care themselves, the Gods
 Ordain man's miserable race to mourn.
 Fast by the threshold of Jove's courts are placed
 Two casks, one stored with evil, one with good,
 From which the God dispenses as he wills.
 For whom the glorious Thunderer mingles both,
 He leads a life checker'd with good and ill
 Alternate; but to whom he gives unmixt
 The bitter cup, he makes that man a curse,
 His name becomes a by-word of reproach,
 His strength is hunger-bitten, and he walks
 The blessed earth, unblest, go where he may.
 So was my father Peleus at his birth
 Nobly endow'd with plenty and with wealth
 Distinguish'd by the Gods past all mankind,
 Lord of the Myrmidons, and, though a man,
 Yet match'd from heaven with an immortal bride.
 But even him the Gods afflict, a son
 Refusing him, who might possess his throne
 Hereafter; for myself, his only heir,
 Pass as a dream, and while I live, instead
 Of solacing his age, here sit, before
 Your distant walls, the scourge of thee and thine.
 Thee also, ancient Priam, we have heard
 Reported, once possessor of such wealth
 As neither Lesbos, seat of Macar, owns,
 Nor eastern Phrygia, nor yet all the ports
 Of Hellespont, but thou didst pass them all
 In riches, and in number of thy sons.
 But since the Powers of heaven brought on thy land
 This fatal war, battle and deeds of death
 Always surround the city where thou reign'st.
 Cease, therefore, from unprofitable tears,
 Which, ere they raise thy son to life again
 Shall, doubtless, find fresh cause for which to flow.
 To whom the ancient King godlike replied.
 Hero, forbear. No seat is here for me,
 While Hector lies unburied in your camp.
 Loose him, and loose him now, that with these eyes
 I may behold my son; accept a price
 Magnificent, which may'st thou long enjoy,
 And, since my life was precious in thy sight,
 May'st thou revisit safe thy native shore!
 To whom Achilles, lowering, and in wrath.[13]
 Urge me no longer, at a time like this,
 With that harsh note; I am already inclin'd
 To loose him. Thetis, my own mother came
 Herself on that same errand, sent from Jove.
 Priam! I understand thee well. I know
 That, by some God conducted, thou hast reach'd
 Achaia's fleet; for, without aid divine,
 No mortal even in his prime of youth,
 Had dared the attempt; guards vigilant as ours
 He should not easily elude, such gates,
 So massy, should not easily unbar.
 Thou, therefore, vex me not in my distress,
 Lest I abhor to see thee in my tent,
 And, borne beyond all limits, set at nought
 Thee, and thy prayer, and the command of Jove.
 He said; the old King trembled, and obey'd.
 Then sprang Pelides like a lion forth,
 Not sole, but with his two attendant friends
 Alcimus and Automedon the brave,
 For them (Patroclus slain) he honor'd most
 Of all the Myrmidons. They from the yoke
 Released both steeds and mules, then introduced
 And placed the herald of the hoary King.
 They lighten'd next the litter of its charge
 Inestimable, leaving yet behind
 Two mantles and a vest, that, not unveil'd,
 The body might be borne back into Troy.
 Then, calling forth his women, them he bade
 Lave and anoint the body, but apart,
 Lest haply Priam, noticing his son,
 Through stress of grief should give resentment scope,
 And irritate by some affront himself
 To slay him, in despite of Jove's commands.[14]
 They, therefore, laving and anointing first
 The body, cover'd it with cloak and vest;
 Then, Peleus' son disposed it on the bier,
 Lifting it from the ground, and his two friends
 Together heaved it to the royal wain.
 Achilles, last, groaning, his friend invoked.
 Patroclus! should the tidings reach thine ear,
 Although in Ades, that I have released
 The noble Hector at his father's suit,
 Resent it not; no sordid gifts have paid
 His ransom-price, which thou shalt also share.
 So saying, Achilles to his tent return'd,
 And on the splendid couch whence he had risen
 Again reclined, opposite to the seat
 Of Priam, whom the hero thus bespake.
 Priam! at thy request thy son is loosed,
 And lying on his bier; at dawn of day
 Thou shalt both see him and convey him hence
 Thyself to Troy. But take we now repast;
 For even bright-hair'd Niobe her food
 Forgat not, though of children twelve bereft,
 Of daughters six, and of six blooming sons.
 Apollo these struck from his silver bow,
 And those shaft-arm'd Diana, both incensed
 That oft Latona's children and her own
 Numbering, she scorn'd the Goddess who had borne
 Two only, while herself had twelve to boast.
 Vain boast! those two sufficed to slay them all.
 Nine days they welter'd in their blood, no man
 Was found to bury them, for Jove had changed
 To stone the people; but themselves, at last,
 The Powers of heaven entomb'd them on the tenth.
 Yet even she, once satisfied with tears,
 Remember'd food; and now the rocks among
 And pathless solitudes of Sipylus,
 The rumor'd cradle of the nymphs who dance
 On Achelo�s' banks, although to stone
 Transform'd, she broods her heaven-inflicted woes.
 Come, then, my venerable guest! take we
 Refreshment also; once arrived in Troy
 With thy dear son, thou shalt have time to weep
 Sufficient, nor without most weighty cause.
 So spake Achilles, and, upstarting, slew
 A sheep white-fleeced, which his attendants flay'd,
 And busily and with much skill their task
 Administ'ring, first scored the viands well,
 Then pierced them with the spits, and when the roast
 Was finish'd, drew them from the spits again.
 And now, Automedon dispensed around
 The polish'd board bread in neat baskets piled,
 Which done, Achilles portion'd out to each
 His share, and all assail'd the ready feast.
 But when nor hunger more nor thirst they felt,
 Dardanian Priam, wond'ring at his bulk
 And beauty (for he seem'd some God from heaven)
 Gazed on Achilles, while Achilles held
 Not less in admiration of his looks
 Benign, and of his gentle converse wise,
 Gazed on Dardanian Priam, and, at length
 (The eyes of each gratified to the full)
 The ancient King thus to Achilles spake.
 Hero! dismiss us now each to our bed,
 That there at ease reclined, we may enjoy
 Sweet sleep; for never have these eyelids closed
 Since Hector fell and died, but without cease
 I mourn, and nourishing unnumber'd woes,
 Have roll'd me in the ashes of my courts.
 But I have now both tasted food, and given
 Wine to my lips, untasted till with thee.
 So he, and at his word Achilles bade
 His train beneath his portico prepare
 With all dispatch two couches, purple rugs,
 And arras, and warm mantles over all.
 Forth went the women bearing lights, and spread
 A couch for each, when feigning needful fear,[15]
 Achilles thus his speech to Priam turn'd.
 My aged guest beloved; sleep thou without;
 Lest some Achaian chief (for such are wont
 Ofttimes, here sitting, to consult with me)
 Hither repair; of whom should any chance
 To spy thee through the gloom, he would at once
 Convey the tale to Agamemnon's ear,
 Whence hindrance might arise, and the release
 Haply of Hector's body be delay'd.
 But answer me with truth. How many days
 Wouldst thou assign to the funereal rites
 Of noble Hector, for so long I mean
 Myself to rest, and keep the host at home?
 Then thus the ancient King godlike replied.
 If thou indeed be willing that we give
 Burial to noble Hector, by an act
 So generous, O Achilles! me thou shalt
 Much gratify; for we are shut, thou know'st,
 In Ilium close, and fuel must procure
 From Ida's side remote; fear, too, hath seized
 On all our people. Therefore thus I say.
 Nine days we wish to mourn him in the house;
 To his interment we would give the tenth,
 And to the public banquet; the eleventh
 Shall see us build his tomb; and on the twelfth
 (If war we must) we will to war again.
 To whom Achilles, matchless in the race.
 So be it, ancient Priam! I will curb
 Twelve days the rage of war, at thy desire.[16]
 He spake, and at his wrist the right hand grasp'd
 Of the old sovereign, to dispel his fear.
 Then in the vestibule the herald slept
 And Priam, prudent both, but Peleus' son
 In the interior tent, and at his side
 Bris�is, with transcendent beauty adorn'd.
 Now all, all night, by gentle sleep subdued,
 Both Gods and chariot-ruling warriors lay,
 But not the benefactor of mankind,
 Hermes; him sleep seized not, but deep he mused
 How likeliest from amid the Grecian fleet
 He might deliver by the guard unseen
 The King of Ilium; at his head he stood
 In vision, and the senior thus bespake.
 Ah heedless and secure! hast thou no dread
 Of mischief, ancient King, that thus by foes
 Thou sleep'st surrounded, lull'd by the consent
 And sufferance of Achilles? Thou hast given
 Much for redemption of thy darling son,
 But thrice that sum thy sons who still survive
 Must give to Agamemnon and the Greeks
 For thy redemption, should they know thee here.
 He ended; at the sound alarm'd upsprang
 The King, and roused his herald. Hermes yoked
 Himself both mules and steeds, and through the camp
 Drove them incontinent, by all unseen.
 Soon as the windings of the stream they reach'd,
 Deep-eddied Xanthus, progeny of Jove,
 Mercury the Olympian summit sought,
 And saffron-vested morn o'erspread the earth.
 They, loud lamenting, to the city drove
 Their steeds; the mules close follow'd with the dead.
 Nor warrior yet, nor cinctured matron knew
 Of all in Ilium aught of their approach,
 Cassandra sole except. She, beautiful
 As golden Venus, mounted on the height
 Of Pergamus, her father first discern'd,
 Borne on his chariot-seat erect, and knew:
 The herald heard so oft in echoing Troy;
 Him also on his bier outstretch'd she mark'd,
 Whom the mules drew. Then, shrieking, through the streets
 She ran of Troy, and loud proclaim'd the sight.
 Ye sons of Ilium and ye daughters, haste,
 Haste all to look on Hector, if ye e'er
 With joy beheld him, while he yet survived,
 From fight returning; for all Ilium erst
 In him, and all her citizens rejoiced.
 She spake. Then neither male nor female more
 In Troy remain'd, such sorrow seized on all.
 Issuing from the city-gate, they met
 Priam conducting, sad, the body home,
 And, foremost of them all, the mother flew
 And wife of Hector to the bier, on which
 Their torn-off tresses with unsparing hands
 They shower'd, while all the people wept around.
 All day, and to the going down of day
 They thus had mourn'd the dead before the gates,
 Had not their Sovereign from his chariot-seat
 Thus spoken to the multitude around.
 Fall back on either side, and let the mules
 Pass on; the body in my palace once
 Deposited, ye then may weep your fill.
 He said; they, opening, gave the litter way.
 Arrived within the royal house, they stretch'd
 The breathless Hector on a sumptuous bed,
 And singers placed beside him, who should chant
 The strain funereal; they with many a groan
 The dirge began, and still, at every close,
 The female train with many a groan replied.
 Then, in the midst, Andromache white-arm'd
 Between her palms the dreadful Hector's head
 Pressing, her lamentation thus began.
 [17]My hero! thou hast fallen in prime of life,
 Me leaving here desolate, and the fruit
 Of our ill-fated loves, a helpless child,
 Whom grown to manhood I despair to see.
 For ere that day arrive, down from her height
 Precipitated shall this city fall,
 Since thou hast perish'd once her sure defence,
 Faithful protector of her spotless wives,
 And all their little ones. Those wives shall soon
 In Grecian barks capacious hence be borne,
 And I among the rest. But thee, my child!
 Either thy fate shall with thy mother send
 Captive into a land where thou shalt serve
 In sordid drudgery some cruel lord,
 Or haply some Achaian here, thy hand
 Seizing, shall hurl thee from a turret-top
 To a sad death, avenging brother, son,
 Or father by the hands of Hector slain;
 For he made many a Grecian bite the ground.
 Thy father, boy, bore never into fight
 A milky mind, and for that self-same cause
 Is now bewail'd in every house of Troy.
 Sorrow unutterable thou hast caused
 Thy parents, Hector! but to me hast left
 Largest bequest of misery, to whom,
 Dying, thou neither didst thy arms extend
 Forth from thy bed, nor gavest me precious word
 To be remember'd day and night with tears.
 So spake she weeping, whom her maidens all
 With sighs accompanied, and her complaint
 Mingled with sobs Hecuba next began.
 Ah Hector! dearest to thy mother's heart
 Of all her sons, much must the Gods have loved
 Thee living, whom, though dead, they thus preserve.
 What son soever of our house beside
 Achilles took, over the barren deep
 To Samos, Imbrus, or to Lemnos girt
 With rocks inhospitable, him he sold;
 But thee, by his dread spear of life deprived,
 He dragg'd and dragg'd around Patroclus' tomb,
 As if to raise again his friend to life
 Whom thou hadst vanquish'd; yet he raised him not.
 But as for thee, thou liest here with dew
 Besprinkled, fresh as a young plant,[18] and more
 Resemblest some fair youth by gentle shafts
 Of Phoebus pierced, than one in battle slain.
 So spake the Queen, exciting in all hearts
 Sorrow immeasurable, after whom
 Thus Helen, third, her lamentation pour'd.
 [19]Ah dearer far than all my brothers else
 Of Priam's house! for being Paris' spouse,
 Who brought me (would I had first died!) to Troy,
 I call thy brothers mine; since forth I came
 From Sparta, it is now the twentieth year,
 Yet never heard I once hard speech from thee,
 Or taunt morose, but if it ever chanced,
 That of thy father's house female or male
 Blamed me, and even if herself the Queen
 (For in the King, whate'er befell, I found
 Always a father) thou hast interposed
 Thy gentle temper and thy gentle speech
 To soothe them; therefore, with the same sad drops
 Thy fate, oh Hector! and my own I weep;
 For other friend within the ample bounds
 Of Ilium have I none, nor hope to hear
 Kind word again, with horror view'd by all.
 So Helen spake weeping, to whom with groans
 The countless multitude replied, and thus
 Their ancient sovereign next his people charged.
 Ye Trojans, now bring fuel home, nor fear
 Close ambush of the Greeks; Achilles' self
 Gave me, at my dismission from his fleet,
 Assurance, that from hostile force secure
 We shall remain, till the twelfth dawn arise.
 All, then, their mules and oxen to the wains
 Join'd speedily, and under Ilium's walls
 Assembled numerous; nine whole days they toil'd,
 Bringing much fuel home, and when the tenth
 Bright morn, with light for human kind, arose,
 Then bearing noble Hector forth, with tears
 Shed copious, on the summit of the pile
 They placed him, and the fuel fired beneath.
 But when Aurora, daughter of the Dawn,
 Redden'd the east, then, thronging forth, all Troy
 Encompass'd noble Hector's pile around.
 The whole vast multitude convened, with wine
 They quench'd the pile throughout, leaving no part
 Unvisited, on which the fire had seized.
 His brothers, next, collected, and his friends,
 His white bones, mourning, and with tears profuse
 Watering their cheeks; then in a golden urn
 They placed them, which with mantles soft they veil'd
 M�onian-hued, and, delving, buried it,
 And overspread with stones the spot adust.
 Lastly, short time allowing to the task,
 They heap'd his tomb, while, posted on all sides,
 Suspicious of assault, spies watch'd the Greeks.
 The tomb once heap'd, assembling all again
 Within the palace, they a banquet shared
 Magnificent, by godlike Priam given.

 Such burial the illustrious Hector found.[20]

	[I cannot take my leave of this noble poem, without expressing how much I am struck with this plain conclusion of it. It is like the exit of a great man out of company whom he has entertained magnificently; neither pompous nor familiar; not contemptuous, yet without much ceremony. I recollect nothing, among the works of mere man, that exemplifies so strongly the true style of great antiquity.]--TR.
