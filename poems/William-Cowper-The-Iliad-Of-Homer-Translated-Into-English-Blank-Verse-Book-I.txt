 Argument Of The First Book.


The book opens with an account of a pestilence that prevailed in the Grecian camp, and the cause of it is assigned. A council is called, in which fierce altercation takes place between Agamemnon and Achilles. The latter solemnly renounces the field. Agamemnon, by his heralds, demands Bris�is, and Achilles resigns her. He makes his complaint to Thetis, who undertakes to plead his cause with Jupiter. She pleads it, and prevails. The book concludes with an account of what passed in Heaven on that occasion.

 Achilles sing, O Goddess! Peleus' son;
 His wrath pernicious, who ten thousand woes
 Caused to Achaia's host, sent many a soul
 Illustrious into Ades premature,
 And Heroes gave (so stood the will of Jove)
 To dogs and to all ravening fowls a prey,
 When fierce dispute had separated once
 The noble Chief Achilles from the son
 Of Atreus, Agamemnon, King of men.
 Who them to strife impell'd? What power divine?
 Latona's son and Jove's.[1] For he, incensed
 Against the King, a foul contagion raised
 In all the host, and multitudes destroy'd,
 For that the son of Atreus had his priest
 Dishonored, Chryses. To the fleet he came
 Bearing rich ransom glorious to redeem
 His daughter, and his hands charged with the wreath
 And golden sceptre[2] of the God shaft-arm'd.
 His supplication was at large to all
 The host of Greece, but most of all to two,
 The sons of Atreus, highest in command.
 Ye gallant Chiefs, and ye their gallant host,
 (So may the Gods who in Olympus dwell
 Give Priam's treasures to you for a spoil
 And ye return in safety,) take my gifts
 And loose my child, in honor of the son
 Of Jove, Apollo, archer of the skies.[3]
 At once the voice of all was to respect
 The priest, and to accept the bounteous price;
 But so it pleased not Atreus' mighty son,
 Who with rude threatenings stern him thence dismiss'd.
 Beware, old man! that at these hollow barks
 I find thee not now lingering, or henceforth
 Returning, lest the garland of thy God
 And his bright sceptre should avail thee nought.
 I will not loose thy daughter, till old age
 Steal on her. From her native country far,
 In Argos, in my palace, she shall ply
 The loom, and shall be partner of my bed.
 Move me no more. Begone; hence while thou may'st.
 He spake, the old priest trembled and obey'd.
 Forlorn he roamed the ocean's sounding shore,
 And, solitary, with much prayer his King
 Bright-hair'd Latona's son, Phoebus, implored.[4]
 God of the silver bow, who with thy power
 Encirclest Chrysa, and who reign'st supreme
 In Tenedos and Cilla the divine,
 Sminthian[5] Apollo![6] If I e'er adorned
 Thy beauteous fane, or on the altar burn'd
 The fat acceptable of bulls or goats,
 Grant my petition. With thy shafts avenge
 On the Achaian host thy servant's tears.
 Such prayer he made, and it was heard.[7] The God,
 Down from Olympus with his radiant bow
 And his full quiver o'er his shoulder slung,
 Marched in his anger; shaken as he moved
 His rattling arrows told of his approach.
 Gloomy he came as night; sat from the ships
 Apart, and sent an arrow. Clang'd the cord
 [8]Dread-sounding, bounding on the silver bow.[9]
 Mules first and dogs he struck,[10] but at themselves
 Dispatching soon his bitter arrows keen,
 Smote them. Death-piles on all sides always blazed.
 Nine days throughout the camp his arrows flew;
 The tenth, Achilles from all parts convened
 The host in council. Juno the white-armed
 Moved at the sight of Grecians all around
 Dying, imparted to his mind the thought.[11]
 The full assembly, therefore, now convened,
 Uprose Achilles ardent, and began.
 Atrides! Now, it seems, no course remains
 For us, but that the seas roaming again,
 We hence return; at least if we survive;
 But haste, consult we quick some prophet here
 Or priest, or even interpreter of dreams,
 (For dreams are also of Jove,) that we may learn
 By what crime we have thus incensed Apollo,
 What broken vow, what hecatomb unpaid
 He charges on us, and if soothed with steam
 Of lambs or goats unblemish'd, he may yet
 Be won to spare us, and avert the plague.
 He spake and sat, when Thestor's son arose
 Calchas, an augur foremost in his art,
 Who all things, present, past, and future knew,
 And whom his skill in prophecy, a gift
 Conferred by Phoebus on him, had advanced
 To be conductor of the fleet to Troy;
 He, prudent, them admonishing, replied.[12]
 Jove-loved Achilles! Wouldst thou learn from me
 What cause hath moved Apollo to this wrath,
 The shaft-arm'd King? I shall divulge the cause.
 But thou, swear first and covenant on thy part
 That speaking, acting, thou wilt stand prepared
 To give me succor; for I judge amiss,
 Or he who rules the Argives, the supreme
 O'er all Achaia's host, will be incensed.
 Wo to the man who shall provoke the King
 For if, to-day, he smother close his wrath,
 He harbors still the vengeance, and in time
 Performs it. Answer, therefore, wilt thou save me?
 To whom Achilles, swiftest of the swift.
 What thou hast learn'd in secret from the God
 That speak, and boldly. By the son of Jove,
 Apollo, whom thou, Calchas, seek'st in prayer
 Made for the Dana�, and who thy soul
 Fills with futurity, in all the host
 The Grecian lives not, who while I shall breathe,
 And see the light of day, shall in this camp
 Oppress thee; no, not even if thou name
 Him, Agamemnon, sovereign o'er us all.
 Then was the seer embolden'd, and he spake.
 Nor vow nor hecatomb unpaid on us
 He charges, but the wrong done to his priest
 Whom Agamemnon slighted when he sought
 His daughter's freedom, and his gifts refused.
 He is the cause. Apollo for his sake
 Afflicts and will afflict us, neither end
 Nor intermission of his heavy scourge
 Granting, 'till unredeem'd, no price required,
 The black-eyed maid be to her father sent,
 And a whole hecatomb in Chrysa bleed.
 Then, not before, the God may be appeased.
 He spake and sat; when Atreus' son arose,
 The Hero Agamemnon, throned supreme.
 Tempests of black resentment overcharged
 His heart, and indignation fired his eyes.
 On Calchas lowering, him he first address'd.
 Prophet of mischief! from whose tongue no note
 Of grateful sound to me, was ever heard;
 Ill tidings are thy joy, and tidings glad
 Thou tell'st not, or thy words come not to pass.
 And now among the Dana� thy dreams
 Divulging, thou pretend'st the Archer-God
 For his priest's sake, our enemy, because
 I scorn'd his offer'd ransom of the maid
 Chrys�is, more desirous far to bear
 Her to my home, for that she charms me more
 Than Clytemnestra, my own first espoused,
 With whom, in disposition, feature, form,
 Accomplishments, she may be well compared.
 Yet, being such, I will return her hence
 If that she go be best. Perish myself--
 But let the people of my charge be saved
 Prepare ye, therefore, a reward for me,
 And seek it instant. It were much unmeet
 That I alone of all the Argive host
 Should want due recompense, whose former prize
 Is elsewhere destined, as ye all perceive.
 To whom Achilles, matchless in the race.
 Atrides, glorious above all in rank,
 And as intent on gain as thou art great,
 Whence shall the Grecians give a prize to thee?
 The general stock is poor; the spoil of towns
 Which we have taken, hath already passed
 In distribution, and it were unjust
 To gather it from all the Greeks again.
 But send thou back this Virgin to her God,
 And when Jove's favor shall have given us Troy,
 A threefold, fourfold share shall then be thine.
 To whom the Sovereign of the host replied.
 Godlike Achilles, valiant as thou art,
 Wouldst thou be subtle too? But me no fraud
 Shall overreach, or art persuade, of thine.
 Wouldst thou, that thou be recompensed, and I
 Sit meekly down, defrauded of my due?
 And didst thou bid me yield her? Let the bold
 Achaians give me competent amends,
 Such as may please me, and it shall be well.
 Else, if they give me none, I will command
 Thy prize, the prize of Ajax, or the prize
 It may be of Ulysses to my tent,
 And let the loser chafe. But this concern
 Shall be adjusted at convenient time.
 Come--launch we now into the sacred deep
 A bark with lusty rowers well supplied;
 Then put on board Chrys�is, and with her
 The sacrifice required. Go also one
 High in authority, some counsellor,
 Idomeneus, or Ajax, or thyself,
 Thou most untractable of all mankind;
 And seek by rites of sacrifice and prayer
 To appease Apollo on our host's behalf.
 Achilles eyed him with a frown, and spake.
 Ah! clothed with impudence as with a cloak,
 And full of subtlety, who, thinkest thou--
 What Grecian here will serve thee, or for thee
 Wage covert war, or open? Me thou know'st,
 Troy never wronged; I came not to avenge
 Harm done to me; no Trojan ever drove
 My pastures, steeds or oxen took of mine,
 Or plunder'd of their fruits the golden fields
 Of Phthia[13] the deep-soil'd. She lies remote,
 And obstacles are numerous interposed,
 Vale-darkening mountains, and the dashing sea.
 No, [14]Shameless Wolf! For thy good pleasure's sake
 We came, and, [15]Face of flint! to avenge the wrongs
 By Menelaus and thyself sustain'd,
 On the offending Trojan--service kind,
 But lost on thee, regardless of it all.
 And now--What now? Thy threatening is to seize
 Thyself, the just requital of my toils,
 My prize hard-earn'd, by common suffrage mine.
 I never gain, what Trojan town soe'er
 We ransack, half thy booty. The swift march
 And furious onset--these I largely reap,
 But, distribution made, thy lot exceeds
 Mine far; while I, with any pittance pleased,
 Bear to my ships the little that I win
 After long battle, and account it much.
 But I am gone, I and my sable barks
 (My wiser course) to Phthia, and I judge,
 Scorn'd as I am, that thou shalt hardly glean
 Without me, more than thou shalt soon consume.[16]
 He ceased, and Agamemnon thus replied
 Fly, and fly now; if in thy soul thou feel
 Such ardor of desire to go--begone!
 I woo thee not to stay; stay not an hour
 On my behalf, for I have others here
 Who will respect me more, and above all
 All-judging Jove. There is not in the host
 King or commander whom I hate as thee,
 For all thy pleasure is in strife and blood,
 And at all times; yet valor is no ground
 Whereon to boast, it is the gift of Heaven
 Go, get ye back to Phthia, thou and thine!
 There rule thy Myrmidons.[17] I need not thee,
 Nor heed thy wrath a jot. But this I say,
 Sure as Apollo takes my lovely prize
 Chrys�is, and I shall return her home
 In mine own bark, and with my proper crew,
 So sure the fair Bris�is shall be mine.
 I shall demand her even at thy tent.
 So shalt thou well be taught, how high in power
 I soar above thy pitch, and none shall dare
 Attempt, thenceforth, comparison with me.
 He ended, and the big, disdainful heart
 Throbbed of Achilles; racking doubt ensued
 And sore perplex'd him, whether forcing wide
 A passage through them, with his blade unsheathed
 To lay Atrides breathless at his foot,
 Or to command his stormy spirit down.
 So doubted he, and undecided yet
 Stood drawing forth his falchion huge; when lo!
 Down sent by Juno, to whom both alike
 Were dear, and who alike watched over both,
 Pallas descended. At his back she stood
 To none apparent, save himself alone,
 And seized his golden locks. Startled, he turned,
 And instant knew Minerva. Flashed her eyes
 Terrific;[18] whom with accents on the wing
 Of haste, incontinent he questioned thus.
 Daughter of Jove, why comest thou? that thyself
 May'st witness these affronts which I endure
 From Agamemnon? Surely as I speak,
 This moment, for his arrogance, he dies.
 To whom the blue-eyed Deity. From heaven
 Mine errand is, to sooth, if thou wilt hear,
 Thine anger. Juno the white-arm'd alike
 To him and thee propitious, bade me down:
 Restrain thy wrath. Draw not thy falchion forth.
 Retort, and sharply, and let that suffice.
 For I foretell thee true. Thou shalt receive,
 Some future day, thrice told, thy present loss
 For this day's wrong. Cease, therefore, and be still.
 To whom Achilles. Goddess, although much
 Exasperate, I dare not disregard
 Thy word, which to obey is always best.[19]
 Who hears the Gods, the Gods hear also him.
 He said; and on his silver hilt the force
 Of his broad hand impressing, sent the blade
 Home to its rest, nor would the counsel scorn
 Of Pallas. She to heaven well-pleased return'd,
 And in the mansion of Jove �gis[20]-armed
 Arriving, mingled with her kindred Gods.
 But though from violence, yet not from words
 Abstained Achilles, but with bitter taunt
 Opprobrious, his antagonist reproached.
 Oh charged with wine, in steadfastness of face
 Dog unabashed, and yet at heart a deer!
 Thou never, when the troops have taken arms,
 Hast dared to take thine also; never thou
 Associate with Achaia's Chiefs, to form
 The secret ambush.[21] No. The sound of war
 Is as the voice of destiny to thee.
 Doubtless the course is safer far, to range
 Our numerous host, and if a man have dared
 Dispute thy will, to rob him of his prize.
 King! over whom? Women and spiritless--
 Whom therefore thou devourest; else themselves
 Would stop that mouth that it should scoff no more.
 But hearken. I shall swear a solemn oath.
 By this same sceptre,[22] which shall never bud,
 Nor boughs bring forth as once, which having left
 Its stock on the high mountains, at what time
 The woodman's axe lopped off its foliage green,
 And stript its bark, shall never grow again;
 Which now the judges of Achaia bear,
 Who under Jove, stand guardians of the laws,
 By this I swear (mark thou the sacred oath)
 Time shall be, when Achilles shall be missed;
 When all shall want him, and thyself the power
 To help the Achaians, whatsoe'er thy will;
 When Hector at your heels shall mow you down:
 The Hero-slaughtering Hector! Then thy soul,
 Vexation-stung, shall tear thee with remorse,
 That thou hast scorn'd, as he were nothing worth,
 A Chief, the soul and bulwark of your cause.
 So saying, he cast his sceptre on the ground
 Studded with gold, and sat. On the other side
 The son of Atreus all impassion'd stood,
 When the harmonious orator arose
 Nestor, the Pylian oracle, whose lips
 Dropped eloquence--the honey not so sweet.
 Two generations past of mortals born
 In Pylus, co�taneous with himself,
 He govern'd now the third--amid them all
 He stood, and thus, benevolent, began.
 Ah! what calamity hath fall'n on Greece!
 Now Priam and his sons may well exult,
 Now all in Ilium shall have joy of heart
 Abundant, hearing of this broil, the prime
 Of Greece between, in council and in arms.
 But be persuaded; ye are younger both
 Than I, and I was conversant of old
 With Princes your superiors, yet from them
 No disrespect at any time received.
 Their equals saw I never; never shall;
 Exadius, Coeneus, and the Godlike son
 Of �geus, mighty Theseus; men renown'd
 For force superior to the race of man,
 Brave Chiefs they were, and with brave foes they fought,
 With the rude dwellers on the mountain-heights
 The Centaurs,[23] whom with havoc such as fame
 Shall never cease to celebrate, they slew.
 With these men I consorted erst, what time
 From Pylus, though a land from theirs remote,

 They called me forth, and such as was my strength,
 With all that strength I served them. Who is he?
 What Prince or Chief of the degenerate race
 Now seen on earth who might with these compare?
 Yet even these would listen and conform
 To my advice in consultation given,
 Which hear ye also; for compliance proves
 Oft times the safer and the manlier course.
 Thou, Agamemnon! valiant as thou art,
 Seize not the maid, his portion from the Greeks,
 But leave her his; nor thou, Achilles, strive
 With our imperial Chief; for never King
 Had equal honor at the hands of Jove
 With Agamemnon, or was throned so high.
 Say thou art stronger, and art Goddess-born,
 How then? His territory passes thine,
 And he is Lord of thousands more than thou.
 Cease, therefore, Agamemnon; calm thy wrath;
 And it shall be mine office to entreat
 Achilles also to a calm, whose might
 The chief munition is of all our host.
 To whom the sovereign of the Greeks replied,
 The son of Atreus. Thou hast spoken well,
 Old Chief, and wisely. But this wrangler here--
 Nought will suffice him but the highest place:
 He must control us all, reign over all,
 Dictate to all; but he shall find at least
 One here, disposed to question his commands.
 If the eternal Gods have made him brave,
 Derives he thence a privilege to rail?
 Whom thus Achilles interrupted fierce.
 Could I be found so abject as to take
 The measure of my doings at thy lips,
 Well might they call me coward through the camp,
 A vassal, and a fellow of no worth.
 Give law to others. Think not to control
 Me, subject to thy proud commands no more.
 Hear yet again! And weigh what thou shalt hear.
 I will not strive with thee in such a cause,
 Nor yet with any man; I scorn to fight
 For her, whom having given, ye take away.
 But I have other precious things on board;
 Of those take none away without my leave.
 Or if it please thee, put me to the proof
 Before this whole assembly, and my spear
 Shall stream that moment, purpled with thy blood.
 Thus they long time in opposition fierce
 Maintained the war of words; and now, at length,
 (The grand consult dissolved,) Achilles walked
 (Patroclus and the Myrmidons his steps
 Attending) to his camp and to his fleet.
 But Agamemnon order'd forth a bark,
 A swift one, manned with twice ten lusty rowers;
 He sent on board the Hecatomb:[24] he placed
 Chrys�is with the blooming cheeks, himself,
 And to Ulysses gave the freight in charge.
 So all embarked, and plow'd their watery way.
 Atrides, next, bade purify the host;
 The host was purified, as he enjoin'd,
 And the ablution cast into the sea.
 Then to Apollo, on the shore they slew,
 Of the untillable and barren deep,
 Whole Hecatombs of bulls and goats, whose steam
 Slowly in smoky volumes climbed the skies.
 Thus was the camp employed; nor ceased the while
 The son of Atreus from his threats denounced
 At first against Achilles, but command
 Gave to Talthybius and Eurybates
 His heralds, ever faithful to his will.
 Haste--Seek ye both the tent of Peleus' son
 Achilles. Thence lead hither by the hand
 Blooming Bris�is, whom if he withhold,
 Not her alone, but other spoil myself
 Will take in person--He shall rue the hour.
 With such harsh message charged he them dismissed
 They, sad and slow, beside the barren waste
 Of Ocean, to the galleys and the tents
 Moved of the Myrmidons. Him there they found
 Beneath the shadow of his bark reclined,
 Nor glad at their approach. Trembling they stood,
 In presence of the royal Chief, awe-struck,
 Nor questioned him or spake. He not the less
 Knew well their embassy, and thus began.
 Ye heralds, messengers of Gods and men,
 Hail, and draw near! I bid you welcome both.
 I blame not you; the fault is his alone
 Who sends you to conduct the damsel hence
 Bris�is. Go, Patroclus, generous friend!
 Lead forth, and to their guidance give the maid.
 But be themselves my witnesses before
 The blessed Gods, before mankind, before
 The ruthless king, should want of me be felt
 To save the host from havoc[25]--Oh, his thoughts
 Are madness all; intelligence or skill,
 Forecast or retrospect, how best the camp
 May be secured from inroad, none hath he.
 He ended, nor Patroclus disobey'd,
 But leading beautiful Bris�is forth
 Into their guidance gave her; loth she went
 From whom she loved, and looking oft behind.
 Then wept Achilles, and apart from all,
 With eyes directed to the gloomy Deep
 And arms outstretch'd, his mother suppliant sought.
 Since, mother, though ordain'd so soon to die,
 I am thy son, I might with cause expect
 Some honor at the Thunderer's hands, but none
 To me he shows, whom Agamemnon, Chief
 Of the Achaians, hath himself disgraced,
 Seizing by violence my just reward.
 So prayed he weeping, whom his mother heard
 Within the gulfs of Ocean where she sat
 Beside her ancient sire. From the gray flood
 Ascending sudden, like a mist she came,
 Sat down before him, stroked his face, and said.
 Why weeps my son? and what is thy distress?
 Hide not a sorrow that I wish to share.
 To whom Achilles, sighing deep, replied.
 Why tell thee woes to thee already known?
 At Thebes, E�tion's city we arrived,
 Smote, sack'd it, and brought all the spoil away.
 Just distribution made among the Greeks,
 The son of Atreus for his lot received
 Blooming Chrys�is. Her, Apollo's priest
 Old Chryses followed to Achaia's camp,
 That he might loose his daughter. Ransom rich
 He brought, and in his hands the hallow'd wreath
 And golden sceptre of the Archer God
 Apollo, bore; to the whole Grecian host,
 But chiefly to the foremost in command
 He sued, the sons of Atreus; then, the rest
 All recommended reverence of the Seer,
 And prompt acceptance of his costly gifts.
 But Agamemnon might not so be pleased,
 Who gave him rude dismission; he in wrath
 Returning, prayed, whose prayer Apollo heard,
 For much he loved him. A pestiferous shaft
 He instant shot into the Grecian host,
 And heap'd the people died. His arrows swept
 The whole wide camp of Greece, 'till at the last
 A Seer, by Phoebus taught, explain'd the cause.
 I first advised propitiation. Rage
 Fired Agamemnon. Rising, he denounced
 Vengeance, and hath fulfilled it. She, in truth,
 Is gone to Chrysa, and with her we send
 Propitiation also to the King
 Shaft-arm'd Apollo. But my beauteous prize
 Bris�is, mine by the award of all,
 His heralds, at this moment, lead away.
 But thou, wherein thou canst, aid thy own son!
 Haste hence to Heaven, and if thy word or deed
 Hath ever gratified the heart of Jove,
 With earnest suit press him on my behalf.
 For I, not seldom, in my father's hall
 Have heard thee boasting, how when once the Gods,
 With Juno, Neptune, Pallas at their head,
 Conspired to bind the Thunderer, thou didst loose
 His bands, O Goddess! calling to his aid
 The Hundred-handed warrior, by the Gods
 Briareus, but by men, �geon named.[26]
 For he in prowess and in might surpassed
 His father Neptune, who, enthroned sublime,
 Sits second only to Saturnian Jove,
 Elate with glory and joy. Him all the Gods
 Fearing from that bold enterprise abstained.
 Now, therefore, of these things reminding Jove,
 Embrace his knees; entreat him that he give
 The host of Troy his succor, and shut fast
 The routed Grecians, prisoners in the fleet,
 That all may find much solace[27] in their King,
 And that the mighty sovereign o'er them all,
 Their Agamemnon, may himself be taught
 His rashness, who hath thus dishonor'd foul
 The life itself, and bulwark of his cause.
 To him, with streaming eyes, Thetis replied.
 Born as thou wast to sorrow, ah, my son!
 Why have I rear'd thee! Would that without tears,
 Or cause for tears (transient as is thy life,
 A little span) thy days might pass at Troy!
 But short and sorrowful the fates ordain
 Thy life, peculiar trouble must be thine,
 Whom, therefore, oh that I had never borne!
 But seeking the Olympian hill snow-crown'd,
 I will myself plead for thee in the ear
 Of Jove, the Thunderer. Meantime at thy fleet
 Abiding, let thy wrath against the Greeks
 Still burn, and altogether cease from war.
 For to the banks of the Oceanus,[28]
 Where �thiopia holds a feast to Jove,[29]
 He journey'd yesterday, with whom the Gods
 Went also, and the twelfth day brings them home.
 Then will I to his brazen-floor'd abode,
 That I may clasp his knees, and much misdeem
 Of my endeavor, or my prayer shall speed.
 So saying, she went; but him she left enraged
 For fair Bris�is' sake, forced from his arms
 By stress of power. Meantime Ulysses came
 To Chrysa with the Hecatomb in charge.
 Arrived within the haven[30] deep, their sails
 Furling, they stowed them in the bark below.
 Then by its tackle lowering swift the mast
 Into its crutch, they briskly push'd to land,
 Heaved anchors out, and moor'd the vessel fast.
 Forth came the mariners, and trod the beach;
 Forth came the victims of Apollo next,
 And, last, Chrys�is. Her Ulysses led
 Toward the altar, gave her to the arms
 Of her own father, and him thus address'd.
 O Chryses! Agamemnon, King of men,
 Hath sent thy daughter home, with whom we bring
 A Hecatomb on all our host's behalf
 To Phoebus, hoping to appease the God
 By whose dread shafts the Argives now expire.
 So saying, he gave her to him, who with joy
 Received his daughter. Then, before the shrine
 Magnificent in order due they ranged
 The noble Hecatomb.[31] Each laved his hands
 And took the salted meal, and Chryses made
 His fervent prayer with hands upraised on high.
 God of the silver bow, who with thy power
 Encirclest Chrysa, and who reign'st supreme
 In Tenedos, and Cilla the divine!
 Thou prov'dst propitious to my first request,
 Hast honor'd me, and punish'd sore the Greeks;
 Hear yet thy servant's prayer; take from their host
 At once the loathsome pestilence away!
 So Chryses prayed, whom Phoebus heard well-pleased;
 Then prayed the Grecians also, and with meal
 Sprinkling the victims, their retracted necks
 First pierced, then flay'd them; the disjointed thighs
 They, next, invested with the double caul,
 Which with crude slices thin they overspread.
 The priest burned incense, and libation poured
 Large on the hissing brands, while, him beside,
 Busy with spit and prong, stood many a youth
 Trained to the task. The thighs with fire consumed,
 They gave to each his portion of the maw,
 Then slashed the remnant, pierced it with the spits,
 And managing with culinary skill
 The roast, withdrew it from the spits again.
 Their whole task thus accomplish'd, and the board
 Set forth, they feasted, and were all sufficed.
 When neither hunger more nor thirst remained
 Unsatisfied, boys crown'd the beakers high
 With wine delicious, and from right to left
 Distributing the cups, served every guest.
 Thenceforth the youths of the Achaian race
 To song propitiatory gave the day,
 P�ans[32] to Phoebus, Archer of the skies,
 Chaunting melodious. Pleased, Apollo heard.
 But, when, the sun descending, darkness fell,
 They on the beach beside their hawsers slept;
 And, when the day-spring's daughter rosy-palm'd
 Aurora look'd abroad, then back they steer'd
 To the vast camp. Fair wind, and blowing fresh,
 Apollo sent them; quick they rear'd the mast,
 Then spread the unsullied canvas to the gale,
 And the wind filled it. Roared the sable flood
 Around the bark, that ever as she went
 Dash'd wide the brine, and scudded swift away.
 Thus reaching soon the spacious camp of Greece,
 Their galley they updrew sheer o'er the sands
 From the rude surge remote, then propp'd her sides
 With scantlings long,[33] and sought their several tents.
 But Peleus' noble son, the speed-renown'd
 Achilles, he, his well-built bark beside,
 Consumed his hours, nor would in council more,
 Where wise men win distinction, or in fight
 Appear, to sorrow and heart-withering wo
 Abandon'd; though for battle, ardent, still
 He panted, and the shout-resounding field.
 But when the twelfth fair morrow streak'd the East,
 Then all the everlasting Gods to Heaven
 Resorted, with the Thunderer at their head,
 And Thetis, not unmindful of her son,
 Prom the salt flood emerged, seeking betimes
 Olympus and the boundless fields of heaven.
 High, on the topmost eminence sublime
 Of the deep-fork'd Olympian she perceived
 The Thunderer seated, from the Gods apart.
 She sat before him, clasp'd with her left hand
 His knees, her right beneath his chin she placed,
 And thus the King, Saturnian Jove, implored.
 Father of all, by all that I have done
 Or said that ever pleased thee, grant my suit.
 Exalt my son, by destiny short-lived
 Beyond the lot of others. Him with shame
 The King of men hath overwhelm'd, by force
 Usurping his just meed; thou, therefore, Jove,
 Supreme in wisdom, honor him, and give
 Success to Troy, till all Achaia's sons
 Shall yield him honor more than he hath lost!
 She spake, to whom the Thunderer nought replied,
 But silent sat long time. She, as her hand
 Had grown there, still importunate, his knees
 Clasp'd as at first, and thus her suit renew'd.[34]
 Or grant my prayer, and ratify the grant,
 Or send me hence (for thou hast none to fear)
 Plainly refused; that I may know and feel
 By how much I am least of all in heaven.
 To whom the cloud-assembler at the last
 Spake, deep-distress'd. Hard task and full of strife
 Thou hast enjoined me; Juno will not spare
 For gibe and taunt injurious, whose complaint
 Sounds daily in the ears of all the Gods,
 That I assist the Trojans; but depart,
 Lest she observe thee; my concern shall be
 How best I may perform thy full desire.
 And to assure thee more, I give the sign
 Indubitable, which all fear expels
 At once from heavenly minds. Nought, so confirmed,
 May, after, be reversed or render'd vain.
 He ceased, and under his dark brows the nod
 Vouchsafed of confirmation. All around
 The Sovereign's everlasting head his curls
 Ambrosial shook,[35] and the huge mountain reeled.
 Their conference closed, they parted. She, at once,
 From bright Olympus plunged into the flood
 Profound, and Jove to his own courts withdrew.
 Together all the Gods, at his approach,
 Uprose; none sat expectant till he came,
 But all advanced to meet the Eternal Sire.
 So on his throne he sat. Nor Juno him
 Not understood; she, watchful, had observed,
 In consultation close with Jove engaged
 Thetis, bright-footed daughter of the deep,
 And keen the son of Saturn thus reproved.
 Shrewd as thou art, who now hath had thine ear?
 Thy joy is ever such, from me apart
 To plan and plot clandestine, and thy thoughts,
 Think what thou may'st, are always barred to me.
 To whom the father, thus, of heaven and earth.
 Expect not, Juno, that thou shalt partake
 My counsels at all times, which oft in height
 And depth, thy comprehension far exceed,
 Jove's consort as thou art. When aught occurs
 Meet for thine ear, to none will I impart
 Of Gods or men more free than to thyself.
 But for my secret thoughts, which I withhold
 From all in heaven beside, them search not thou
 With irksome curiosity and vain.
 Him answer'd then the Goddess ample-eyed.[36]
 What word hath passed thy lips, Saturnian Jove,
 Thou most severe! I never search thy thoughts,
 Nor the serenity of thy profound
 Intentions trouble; they are safe from me:
 But now there seems a cause. Deeply I dread
 Lest Thetis, silver-footed daughter fair
 Of Ocean's hoary Sovereign, here arrived
 At early dawn to practise on thee, Jove!
 I noticed her a suitress at thy knees,
 And much misdeem or promise-bound thou stand'st
 To Thetis past recall, to exalt her son,
 And Greeks to slaughter thousands at the ships.
 To whom the cloud-assembler God, incensed.
 Ah subtle! ever teeming with surmise,
 And fathomer of my concealed designs,
 Thy toil is vain, or (which is worse for thee,)
 Shall but estrange thee from mine heart the more.
 And be it as thou sayest,--I am well pleased
 That so it should be. Be advised, desist,
 Hold thou thy peace. Else, if my glorious hands
 Once reach thee, the Olympian Powers combined
 To rescue thee, shall interfere in vain.
 He said,--whom Juno, awful Goddess, heard
 Appall'd, and mute submitted to his will.
 But through the courts of Jove the heavenly Powers
 All felt displeasure; when to them arose
 Vulcan, illustrious artist, who with speech
 Conciliatory interposed to sooth
 His white-armed mother Juno, Goddess dread.
 Hard doom is ours, and not to be endured,
 If feast and merriment must pause in heaven
 While ye such clamor raise tumultuous here
 For man's unworthy sake: yet thus we speed
 Ever, when evil overpoises good.
 But I exhort my mother, though herself
 Already warn'd, that meekly she submit
 To Jove our father, lest our father chide
 More roughly, and confusion mar the feast.
 For the Olympian Thunderer could with ease
 Us from our thrones precipitate, so far
 He reigns to all superior. Seek to assuage
 His anger therefore; so shall he with smiles
 Cheer thee, nor thee alone, but all in heaven.
 So Vulcan, and, upstarting, placed a cup
 Full-charged between his mother's hands, and said,
 My mother, be advised, and, though aggrieved,
 Yet patient; lest I see thee whom I love
 So dear, with stripes chastised before my face,
 Willing, but impotent to give thee aid.[37]
 Who can resist the Thunderer? Me, when once
 I flew to save thee, by the foot he seized
 And hurl'd me through the portal of the skies.
 "From morn to eve I fell, a summer's day,"
 And dropped, at last, in Lemnos. There half-dead
 The Sintians found me, and with succor prompt
 And hospitable, entertained me fallen.
 So He; then Juno smiled, Goddess white-arm'd,
 And smiling still, from his unwonted hand[38]
 Received the goblet. He from right to left
 Rich nectar from the beaker drawn, alert
 Distributed to all the powers divine.
 Heaven rang with laughter inextinguishable
 Peal after peal, such pleasure all conceived
 At sight of Vulcan in his new employ.
 So spent they in festivity the day,
 And all were cheered; nor was Apollo's harp
 Silent, nor did the Muses spare to add
 Responsive melody of vocal sweets.
 But when the sun's bright orb had now declined,
 Each to his mansion, wheresoever built
 By the lame matchless Architect, withdrew.[39]
 Jove also, kindler of the fires of heaven,
 His couch ascending as at other times
 When gentle sleep approach'd him, slept serene,
 With golden-sceptred Juno at his side.



	The first book contains the preliminaries to the commencement of serious action. First, the visit of the priest of Apollo to ransom his captive daughter, the refusal of Agamemnon to yield her up, and the pestilence sent by the god upon the Grecian army in consequence. Secondly, the restoration, the propitiation of Apollo, the quarrel of Agamemnon and Achilles, and the withdrawing of the latter from the Grecian army. Thirdly, the intercession of Thetis with Jupiter; his promise, unwillingly given, to avenge Achilles; and the assembly of the gods, in which the promise is angrily alluded to by Juno, and the discussion peremptorily checked by Jupiter. The poet, throughout this book, maintains a simple, unadorned style, but highly descriptive, and happily adapted to the nature of the subject.--FELTON.
