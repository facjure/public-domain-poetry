 Thou canst not see him standing by - 
 Time - with a poppied hand
 Stealing thy youth's simplicity,
 Even as falls unceasingly
 His waning sand.

 He will pluck thy childish roses, as
 Summer from her bush
 Strips all the loveliness that was;
 Even to the silence evening has
 Thy laughter hush.

 Thy locks too faint for earthly gold,
 The meekness of thine eyes,
 He will darken and dim, and to his fold
 Drive, 'gainst the night, thy stainless, old
 Innocencies;

 Thy simple words confuse and mar,
 Thy tenderest thoughts delude,
 Draw a long cloud athwart thy star,
 Still with loud timbrels heaven's far
 Faint interlude.

 Thou canst not see; I see, dearest;
 O, then, yet patient be,
 Though love refuse thy heart all rest,
 Though even love wax angry, lest
 Love should lose thee ?
