title: At Aunty's House
---

One time, when we'z at Aunty's house -
 'Way in the country! - where
They's ist but woods - an' pigs, an' cows -
 An' all's out-doors an' air! -
An' orchurd-swing; an' churry-trees -
An' churries in 'em! - Yes, an' these -
Here red-head birds steals all they please,
 An' tetch 'em ef you dare! -
W'y, wunst, one time, when we wuz there,
 We et out on the porch!

Wite where the cellar-door wuz shut
 The table wuz; an' I
Let Aunty set by me an' cut
 My vittuls up - an' pie.
'Tuz awful funny! - I could see
The red-heads in the churry-tree;
An' bee-hives, where you got to be
 So keerful, goin' by; -
An' "Comp'ny" there an' all! - an' we -
 We et out on the porch!

An' I ist et p'surves an' things
 'At Ma don't 'low me to -
An' chickun-gizzurds - (don't like wings
 Like Parunts does! do you?)
An' all the time, the wind blowed there,
An' I could feel it in my hair,
An' ist smell clover ever'where! -
 An' a' old red-head flew
Purt' nigh wite over my high-chair,
 When we et on the porch!
