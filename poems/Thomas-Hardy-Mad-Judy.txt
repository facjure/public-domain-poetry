When the hamlet hailed a birth
 Judy used to cry:
When she heard our christening mirth
 She would kneel and sigh.
She was crazed, we knew, and we
Humoured her infirmity.

When the daughters and the sons
 Gathered them to wed,
And we like-intending ones
 Danced till dawn was red,
She would rock and mutter, "More
Comers to this stony shore!"

When old Headsman Death laid hands
 On a babe or twain,
She would feast, and by her brands
 Sing her songs again.
What she liked we let her do,
Judy was insane, we knew.
