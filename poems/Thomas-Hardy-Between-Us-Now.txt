title: Between Us Now
---

Between us now and here -
 Two thrown together
Who are not wont to wear
 Life's flushest feather -
Who see the scenes slide past,
The daytimes dimming fast,
Let there be truth at last,
 Even if despair.

So thoroughly and long
 Have you now known me,
So real in faith and strong
 Have I now shown me,
That nothing needs disguise
Further in any wise,
Or asks or justifies
 A guarded tongue.

Face unto face, then, say,
 Eyes mine own meeting,
Is your heart far away,
 Or with mine beating?
When false things are brought low,
And swift things have grown slow,
Feigning like froth shall go,
 Faith be for aye.
