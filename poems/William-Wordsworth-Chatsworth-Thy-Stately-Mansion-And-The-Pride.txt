title: Chatsworth! Thy Stately Mansion, And The Pride
---

 Chatsworth! thy stately mansion, and the pride
 Of thy domain, strange contrast do present
 To house and home in many a craggy rent
 Of the wild Peak; where new-born waters glide
 Through fields whose thrifty occupants abide
 As in a dear and chosen banishment,
 With every semblance of entire content;
 So kind is simple Nature, fairly tried!
 Yet He whose heart in childhood gave her troth
 To pastoral dales, thin-set with modest farms,
 May learn, if judgment strengthen with his growth,
 That, not for Fancy only, pomp hath charms;
 And, strenuous to protect from lawless harms
 The extremes of favoured life, may honour both.
