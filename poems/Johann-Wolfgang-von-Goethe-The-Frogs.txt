title: The Frogs.

A Pool was once congeal'd with frost;
The frogs, in its deep waters lost,

No longer dared to croak or spring;
But promised, being half asleep,
If suffer'd to the air to creep,

As very nightingales to sing.

A thaw dissolved the ice so strong, 
They proudly steer'd themselves along,
When landed, squatted on the shore,
And croak'd as loudly as before.
