 Men of the Western World! in Fate's dark book
 Whence these opprobrious leaves of dire portent?
 Think ye your British Ancestors forsook
 Their native Land, for outrage provident;
 From unsubmissive necks the bridle shook
 To give, in their Descendants, freer vent
 And wider range to passions turbulent,
 To mutual tyranny a deadlier look?
 Nay, said a voice, soft as the south wind's breath,
 Dive through the stormy surface of the flood
 To the great current flowing underneath;
 Explore the countless springs of silent good;
 So shall the truth be better understood,
 And thy grieved Spirit brighten strong in faith.
