title: Intent On Gathering Wool From Hedge And Brake
---

 Intent on gathering wool from hedge and brake
 Yon busy Little-ones rejoice that soon
 A poor old Dame will bless them for the boon:
 Great is their glee while flake they add to flake
 With rival earnestness; far other strife
 Than will hereafter move them, if they make
 Pastime their idol, give their day of life
 To pleasure snatched for reckless pleasure's sake.
 Can pomp and show allay one heart-born grief?
 Pains which the World inflicts can she requite?
 Not for an interval however brief;
 The silent thoughts that search for steadfast light,
 Love from her depths, and Duty in her might,
 And Faith, these only yield secure relief.
