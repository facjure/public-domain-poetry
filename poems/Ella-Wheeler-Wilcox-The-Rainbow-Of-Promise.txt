title: The Rainbow Of Promise
---

In the face of the sun are great thunderbolts hurled,
 And the storm-clouds have shut out its light;
But a Rainbow of Promise now shines on the world,
 And the universe thrills at the sight.

'Tis the flag of our Union, the red, white, and blue,
 Our Star-spangled Banner - our pride;
Fair symbol of all that is noble and true,
 Flung out over continents wide.

Flung out in its glory o'er land and o'er sea,
 With a message from God in each star;
And a glorious promise of peace yet to be
 In the fluttering folds of each bar.

A Rainbow of Promise, bright emblem of hope,
 Fair flag of each cause that is just;
No longer in doubt or in darkness we grope - 
 In the Star-spangled Banner we trust.
