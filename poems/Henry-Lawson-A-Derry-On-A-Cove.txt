title: A Derry On A Cove

�Twas in the felon�s dock he stood, his eyes were black and blue;
His voice with grief was broken, and his nose was broken, too;
He muttered, as that broken nose he wiped upon his cap,
�It�s orfal when the p�leece has got a derry on a chap.

�I am a honest workin� cove, as any bloke can see,
�It�s just because the p�leece has got a derry, sir, on me;
�Oh, yes, the legal gents can grin, I say it ain�t no joke,
�It�s cruel when the p�leece has got a derry on a bloke.�

�Why don�t you go to work?� he said (he muttered, �Why don�t you?�).
�Yer honer knows as well as me there ain�t no work to do.
�And when I try to find a job I�m shaddered by a trap,
�It�s awful when the p�leece has got a derry on a chap.�

I sigh�d and shed a tearlet for that noble nature marred,
But, ah! the Bench was rough on him, and gave him six months� hard.
He only said, �Beyond the grave you�ll cop it hot, by Jove!
�There ain�t no angel p�leece to get a derry on a cove.�
