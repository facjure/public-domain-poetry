title: From A College Window
---

The glimmer of the limes, sun-heavy, sleeping,
 Goes trembling past me up the College wall.
Below, the lawn, in soft blue shade is keeping,
 The daisy-froth quiescent, softly in thrall.

Beyond the leaves that overhang the street,
Along the flagged, clean pavement summer-white,
Passes the world with shadows at their feet
 Going left and right.

Remote, although I hear the beggar's cough,
 See the woman's twinkling fingers tend him a coin,
I sit absolved, assured I am better off
 Beyond a world I never want to join.
