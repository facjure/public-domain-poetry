 I said to Love,
"It is not now as in old days
When men adored thee and thy ways
 All else above;
Named thee the Boy, the Bright, the One
Who spread a heaven beneath the sun,"
 I said to Love.

 I said to him,
"We now know more of thee than then;
We were but weak in judgment when,
 With hearts abrim,
We clamoured thee that thou would'st please
Inflict on us thine agonies,"
 I said to him.

 I said to Love,
"Thou art not young, thou art not fair,
No faery darts, no cherub air,
 Nor swan, nor dove
Are thine; but features pitiless,
And iron daggers of distress,"
 I said to Love.

 "Depart then, Love! . . .
- Man's race shall end, dost threaten thou?
The age to come the man of now
 Know nothing of? -
We fear not such a threat from thee;
We are too old in apathy!
Mankind shall cease. - So let it be,"
 I said to Love.
