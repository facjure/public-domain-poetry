title: How Sleep The Brave
---

How sleep the brave, who sink to rest
By all their country�s wishes blest!
When Spring, with dewy fingers cold,
Returns to deck their hallow�d mould,
She there shall dress a sweeter sod
Than Fancy�s feet have ever trod.

By fairy hands their knell is rung;
By forms unseen their dirge is sung;
There Honour comes, a pilgrim grey,
To bless the turf that wraps their clay;
And Freedom shall awhile repair
To dwell, a weeping hermit, there!
