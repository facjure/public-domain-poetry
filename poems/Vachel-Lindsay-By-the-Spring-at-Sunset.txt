title: By the Spring, at Sunset
---

 Sometimes we remember kisses,
 Remember the dear heart-leap when they came:
 Not always, but sometimes we remember
 The kindness, the dumbness, the good flame
 Of laughter and farewell.

Beside the road
 Afar from those who said "Good-by" I write,
 Far from my city task, my lawful load.

 Sun in my face, wind beside my shoulder,
 Streaming clouds, banners of new-born night
 Enchant me now.The splendors growing bolder
 Make bold my soul for some new wise delight.

 I write the day's event, and quench my drouth,
 Pausing beside the spring with happy mind.
 And now I feel those kisses on my mouth,
 Hers most of all, one little friend most kind.
