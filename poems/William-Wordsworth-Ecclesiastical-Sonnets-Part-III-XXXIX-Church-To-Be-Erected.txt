 Be this the chosen site; the virgin sod,
 Moistened from age to age by dewy eve,
 Shall disappear, and grateful earth receive
 The corner-stone from hands that build to God.
 Yon reverend hawthorns, hardened to the rod
 Of winter storms, yet budding cheerfully;
 Those forest oaks of Druid memory,
 Shall long survive, to shelter the Abode
 Of genuine Faith. Where, haply, 'mid this band
 Of daisies, shepherds sate of yore and wove
 May-garlands, there let the holy altar stand
 For kneeling adoration; while above,
 Broods, visibly portrayed, the mystic Dove,
 That shall protect from blasphemy the Land.
