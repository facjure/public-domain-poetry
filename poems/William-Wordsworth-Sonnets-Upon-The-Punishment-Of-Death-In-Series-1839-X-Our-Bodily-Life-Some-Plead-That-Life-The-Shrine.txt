---

 Our bodily life, some plead, that life the shrine
 Of an immortal spirit, is a gift
 So sacred, so informed with light divine,
 That no tribunal, though most wise to sift
 Deed and intent, should turn the Being adrift
 Into that world where penitential tear
 May not avail, nor prayer have for God's ear
 A voice that world whose veil no hand can lift
 For earthly sight. "Eternity and Time,"
 'They' urge, "have interwoven claims and rights
 Not to be jeopardised through foulest crime:
 The sentence rule by mercy's heaven-born lights."
 Even so; but measuring not by finite sense
 Infinite Power, perfect Intelligence.
