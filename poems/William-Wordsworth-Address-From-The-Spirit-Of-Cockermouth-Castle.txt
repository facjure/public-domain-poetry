title: Address From The Spirit Of Cockermouth Castle

 "Thou look'st upon me, and dost fondly think,
 Poet! that, stricken as both are by years,
 We, differing once so much, are now Compeers,
 Prepared, when each has stood his time, to sink
 Into the dust. Erewhile a sterner link
 United us; when thou, in boyish play,
 Entering my dungeon, didst become a prey
 To soul-appalling darkness. Not a blink
 Of light was there; and thus did I, thy Tutor,
 Make thy young thoughts acquainted with the grave;
 While thou wert chasing the winged butterfly
 Through my green courts; or climbing, a bold suitor,
 Up to the flowers whose golden progeny
 Still round my shattered brow in beauty wave."
