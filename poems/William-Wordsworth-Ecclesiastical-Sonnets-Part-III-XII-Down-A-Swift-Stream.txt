title: Ecclesiastical Sonnets - Part III. - XII - Down A Swift Stream
---

 Down a swift Stream, thus far, a bold design
 Have we pursued, with livelier stir of heart
 Than his who sees, borne forward by the Rhine,
 The living landscapes greet him, and depart;
 Sees spires fast sinking, up again to start!
 And strives the towers to number, that recline
 O'er the dark steeps, or on the horizon line
 Striding with shattered crests his eye athwart,
 So have we hurried on with troubled pleasure:
 Henceforth, as on the bosom of a stream
 That slackens, and spreads wide a watery gleam,
 We, nothing loth a lingering course to measure,
 May gather up our thoughts, and mark at leisure
 How widely spread the interests of our theme.
