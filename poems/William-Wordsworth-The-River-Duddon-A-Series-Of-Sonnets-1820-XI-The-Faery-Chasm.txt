 No fiction was it of the antique age:
 A sky-blue stone, within this sunless cleft,
 Is of the very footmarks unbereft
 Which tiny Elves impressed; on that smooth stage
 Dancing with all their brilliant equipage
 In secret revels, haply after theft
 Of some sweet Babe, Flower stolen, and coarse Weed left
 For the distracted Mother to assuage
 Her grief with, as she might! But, where, oh! where
 Is traceable a vestige of the notes
 That ruled those dances wild in character?
 Deep underground? Or in the upper air,
 On the shrill wind of midnight? or where floats
 O'er twilight fields the autumnal gossamer?
