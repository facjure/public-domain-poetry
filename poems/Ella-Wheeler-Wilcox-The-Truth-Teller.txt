The Truth Teller lifts the curtain,
 And shows us the people's plight;
And everything seems uncertain,
 And nothing at all looks right.
Yet out of the blackness groping,
 My heart finds a world in bloom;
For it somehow is fashioned for hoping,
 And it cannot live in the gloom.

He tells us from border to border,
 That race is warring with race;
With riot and mad disorder,
 The earth is a wretched place;
And yet ere the sun is setting
 I am thinking of peace, not strife;
For my heart has a way of forgetting
 All things save the joy of life.

I heard in my Youth's beginning
 That earth was a region of woe,
And trouble, and sorrow, and sinning:
 The Truth Teller told me so.
I knew it was true, and tragic;
 And I mourned over much that was wrong;
And then, by some curious magic,
 The heart of me burst into song.

The years have been going, going,
 A mixture of pleasure and pain;
But the Truth Teller's books are showing
 That evil is on the gain.
And I know that I ought to be grieving,
 And I should be too sad to sing;
But somehow I keep on believing
 That life is a glorious thing.
