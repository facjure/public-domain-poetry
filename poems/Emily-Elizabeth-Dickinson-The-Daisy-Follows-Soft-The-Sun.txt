title: The Daisy Follows Soft The Sun,
---

The daisy follows soft the sun,
And when his golden walk is done,
 Sits shyly at his feet.
He, waking, finds the flower near.
"Wherefore, marauder, art thou here?"
 "Because, sir, love is sweet!"

We are the flower, Thou the sun!
Forgive us, if as days decline,
 We nearer steal to Thee, --
Enamoured of the parting west,
The peace, the flight, the amethyst,
 Night's possibility!
