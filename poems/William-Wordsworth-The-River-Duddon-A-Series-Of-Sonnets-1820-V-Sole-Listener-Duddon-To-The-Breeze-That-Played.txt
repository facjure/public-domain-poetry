 Sole listener, Duddon! to the breeze that played
 With thy clear voice, I caught the fitful sound
 Wafted o'er sullen moss and craggy mound,
 Unfruitful solitudes, that seemed to upbraid
 The sun in heaven! but now, to form a shade
 For Thee, green alders have together wound
 Their foliage; ashes flung their arms around;
 And birch-trees risen in silver colonnade.
 And thou hast also tempted here to rise,
 'Mid sheltering pines, this Cottage rude and grey;
 Whose ruddy children, by the mother's eyes
 Carelessly watched, sport through the summer day,
 Thy pleased associates: light as endless May
 On infant bosoms lonely Nature lies.
