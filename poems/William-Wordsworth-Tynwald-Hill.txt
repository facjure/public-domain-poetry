 Once on the top of Tynwald's formal mound
 (Still marked with green turf circles narrowing
 Stage above stage) would sit this Island's King,
 The laws to promulgate, enrobed and crowned:
 While, compassing the little mount around,
 Degrees and Orders stood, each under each:
 Now, like to things within fate's easiest reach
 The power is merged, the pomp a grave has found.
 Off with yon cloud, old Snafell! that thine eye
 Over three Realms may take its widest range;
 And let, for them, thy fountains utter strange
 Voices, thy winds break forth in prophecy,
 If the whole State must suffer mortal change
 Like Mona's miniature of sovereignty.
