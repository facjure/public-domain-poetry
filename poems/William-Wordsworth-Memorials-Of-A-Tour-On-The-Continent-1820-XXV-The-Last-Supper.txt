By Leonardo Da Vinci, In The Refectory Of The Convent Of Maria Della Grazia - Milan.

 Tho' searching damps and many an envious flaw
 Have marred this Work; the calm ethereal grace,
 The love deep-seated in the Saviour's face,
 The mercy, goodness, have not failed to awe
 The Elements; as they do melt and thaw
 The heart of the Beholder and erase
 (At least for one rapt moment) every trace
 Of disobedience to the primal law.
 The annunciation of the dreadful truth
 Made to the Twelve, survives: lip, forehead, cheek,
 And hand reposing on the board in ruth
 Of what it utters, while the unguilty seek
 Unquestionable meanings still bespeak
 A labour worthy of eternal youth!
