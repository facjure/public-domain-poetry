 'Twas in a tavern that with old age stooped
 And leaned rheumatic rafters o'er his head - 
 A blowzed, prodigious man, which talked, and stared,
 And rolled, as if with purpose, a small eye
 Like a sweet Cupid in a cask of wine.
 I could not view his fatness for his soul,
 Which peeped like harmless lightnings and was gone;
 As haps to voyagers of the summer air.
 And when he laughed, Time trickled down those beams,
 As in a glass; and when in self-defence
 He puffed that paunch, and wagged that huge, Greek head,
 Nosed like a Punchinello, then it seemed
 An hundred widows swept in his small voice,
 Now tenor, and now bass of drummy war.
 He smiled, compact of loam, this orchard man;
 Mused like a midnight, webbed with moonbeam snares
 Of flitting Love; woke - and a King he stood,
 Whom all the world hath in sheer jest refused
 For helpless laughter's sake. And then, forfend!
 Bacchus and Jove reared vast Olympus there;
 And Pan leaned leering from Promethean eyes.
 "Lord!" sighed his aspect, weeping o'er the jest,
 "What simple mouse brought such a mountain forth?"
