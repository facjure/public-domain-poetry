 Meek Virgin Mother, more benign
 Than fairest Star, upon the height
 Of thy own mountain, set to keep
 Lone vigils through the hours of sleep,
 What eye can look upon thy shrine
 Untroubled at the sight?

 These crowded offerings as they hang
 In sign of misery relieved,
 Even these, without intent of theirs,
 Report of comfortless despairs,
 Of many a deep and cureless pang
 And confidence deceived.

 To Thee, in this aerial cleft,
 As to a common centre, tend
 All sufferers that no more rely
 On mortal succour, all who sigh
 And pine, of human hope bereft,
 Nor wish for earthly friend.

 And hence, O Virgin Mother mild!
 Though plenteous flowers around thee blow,
 Not only from the dreary strife
 Of Winter, but the storms of life,
 Thee have thy Votaries aptly styled,
 Our Lady Of The Snow.

 Even for the Man who stops not here,
 But down the irriguous valley hies,
 Thy very name, O Lady! flings,
 O'er blooming fields and gushing springs,
 A tender sense of shadowy fear,
 And chastening sympathies!

 Nor falls that intermingling shade
 To summer-gladsomeness unkind:
 It chastens only to requite
 With gleams of fresher, purer, light;
 While, o'er the flower-enameled glade,
 More sweetly breathes the wind.

 But on! a tempting downward way,
 A verdant path before us lies;
 Clear shines the glorious sun above;
 Then give free course to joy and love,
 Deeming the evil of the day
 Sufficient for the wise.
