 Lulled by the sound of pastoral bells,
 Rude Nature's Pilgrims did we go,
 From the dread summit of the Queen
 Of mountains, through a deep ravine,
 Where, in her holy chapel, dwells
 "Our Lady of the Snow."

 The sky was blue, the air was mild;
 Free were the streams and green the bowers;
 As if, to rough assaults unknown,
 The genial spot had 'ever' shown
 A countenance that as sweetly smiled
 The face of summer-hours.

 And we were gay, our hearts at ease;
 With pleasure dancing through the frame
 We journeyed; all we knew of care
 Our path that straggled here and there;
 Of trouble, but the fluttering breeze;
 Of Winter, but a name.

 If foresight could have rent the veil
 Of three short days, but hush, no more!
 Calm is the grave, and calmer none
 Than that to which thy cares are gone,
 Thou Victim of the stormy gale;
 Asleep on Zurich's shore!

 O Goddard! what art thou? a name
 A sunbeam followed by a shade!
 Nor more, for aught that time supplies,
 The great, the experienced, and the wise:
 Too much from this frail earth we claim,
 And therefore are betrayed.

 We met, while festive mirth ran wild,
 Where, from a deep lake's mighty urn,
 Forth slips, like an enfranchised slave,
 A sea-green river, proud to lave,
 With current swift and undefiled,
 The towers of old Lucerne.

 We parted upon solemn ground
 Far-lifted towards the unfading sky;
 But all our thoughts were 'then' of Earth,
 That gives to common pleasures birth;
 And nothing in our hearts we found
 That prompted even a sigh.

 Fetch, sympathising Powers of air,
 Fetch, ye that post o'er seas and lands,
 Herbs, moistened by Virginian dew,
 A most untimely grave to strew,
 Whose turf may never know the care
 Of 'kindred' human hands!

 Beloved by every gentle Muse
 He left his Transatlantic home:
 Europe, a realised romance,
 Had opened on his eager glance;
 What present bliss! what golden views!
 What stores for years to come!

 Though lodged within no vigorous frame,
 His soul her daily tasks renewed,
 Blithe as the lark on sun-gilt wings
 High poised, or as the wren that sings
 In shady places, to proclaim
 Her modest gratitude.

 Not vain is sadly-uttered praise;
 The words of truth's memorial vow
 Are sweet as morning fragrance shed
 From flowers 'mid Goldau's ruins bred;
 As evening's fondly-lingering rays,
 On Righi's silent brow.

 Lamented Youth! to thy cold clay
 Fit obsequies the Stranger paid;
 And piety shall guard the Stone
 Which hath not left the spot unknown
 Where the wild waves resigned their prey
 And 'that' which marks thy bed.

 And, when thy Mother weeps for Thee,
 Lost Youth! a solitary Mother;
 This tribute from a casual Friend
 A not unwelcome aid may lend,
 To feed the tender luxury,
 The rising pang to smother.
