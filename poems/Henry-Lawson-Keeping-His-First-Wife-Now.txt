title: Keeping His First Wife Now
---

It's oh! for a rivet in marriage bonds,
And a splice in the knot untied,
The sanctity of the marriage tie
Is growing more sanctified!
They�re getting mixed up in society,
There�s an awful family row,
For Reginald Jones of �The Fernery�
Is �keeping� his first wife now!

Oh! she belonged to the smart, smart set
(Where reasons are far to seek),
And the wedding and �crush� are remembered yet
As the �smart� things of the week.
Never an atom of love had she,
But they had a child somehow,
And Reginald Jones of �The Fernery�
Has the love of his first wife now.

Mad for �notice� and �talk� was she,
A butterfly blind as a bat,
She would flaunt for a season a divorcee,
Or divorce him, failing that.
He played his part and she held his heart
As light as her marriage vow,
But Reginald Jones of �The Fernery�
Has a hold on his first wife now.

She swore in Court what the world knew false,
With never a thought of shame,
She was free to flaunt to her heart�s content,
But she found it mighty tame:
The talk of the �town� for a week or two,
The gush, the smirk and the bow,
But Reginald Jones of �The Fernery�
Is the God of his first wife now!

Her soul grew sick of the smart, smart set,
Or her conscience drove her wild,
Or she craved for �notice� and �talk� once more,
Or perhaps because of the child;
But they met at last and they met again,
No matter the where or how,
And Reginald Jones of �The Fernery�
Is in love with his first wife now.

�Tis a �terrible life� for the second young wife,
But she married him too for �place�;
And she mustn�t forget that a smarting set
Belongs to the human race.
They say it�s fixed up in camera,
And, if that is the case, I�ll vow,
That Reginald Jones of �The Fernery�
Will marry his first wife now.

And there is a song of the English world
And a song for the English race:
The second husband and second wife
Must ever take second place.
So cherish the best that you find in the first,
And a margin of width allow:
The future looks after itself too well!
Look after the first ones now.
