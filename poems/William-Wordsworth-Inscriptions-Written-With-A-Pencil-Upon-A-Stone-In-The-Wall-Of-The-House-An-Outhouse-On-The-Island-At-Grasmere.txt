 Rude is this Edifice, and Thou hast seen
 Buildings, albeit rude, that have maintained
 Proportions more harmonious, and approached
 To closer fellowship with ideal grace.
 But take it in good part:, alas! the poor
 Vitruvius of our village had no help
 From the great City; never, upon leaves
 Of red Morocco folio, saw displayed,
 In long succession, pre-existing ghosts
 Of Beauties yet unborn, the rustic Lodge
 Antique, and Cottage with verandah graced,
 Nor lacking, for fit company, alcove,
 Green-house, shell-grot, and moss-lined hermitage.
 Thou see'st a homely Pile, yet to these walls
 The heifer comes in the snow-storm, and here
 The new-dropped lamb finds shelter from the wind.
 And hither does one Poet sometimes row
 His pinnace, a small vagrant barge, up-piled
 With plenteous store of heath and withered fern,
 (A lading which he with his sickle cuts,
 Among the mountains) and beneath this roof
 He makes his summer couch, and here at noon
 Spreads out his limbs, while, yet unshorn, the Sheep,
 Panting beneath the burthen of their wool,
 Lie round him, even as if they were a part
 Of his own Household: nor, while from his bed
 He looks, through the open door-place, toward the lake
 And to the stirring breezes, does he want
 Creations lovely as the work of sleep,
 Fair sights, and visions of romantic joy!
