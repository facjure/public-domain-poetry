title: Ecclesiastical Sonnets - Part II. - IX - As Faith Thus Sanctified The Warrior's Crest
---

 As faith thus sanctified the warrior's crest
 While from the Papal Unity there came,
 What feebler means had failed to give, one aim
 Diffused thro' all the regions of the West;
 So does her Unity its power attest
 By works of Art, that shed, on the outward frame
 Of worship, glory and grace, which who shall blame
 That ever looked to heaven for final rest?
 Hail countless Temples! that so well befit
 Your ministry; that, as ye rise and take
 Form spirit and character from holy writ,
 Give to devotion, wheresoe'er awake,
 Pinions of high and higher sweep, and make
 The unconverted soul with awe submit.
