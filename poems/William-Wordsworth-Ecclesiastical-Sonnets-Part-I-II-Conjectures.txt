 If there be prophets on whose spirits rest
 Past things, revealed like future, they can tell
 What Powers, presiding o'er the sacred well
 Of Christian Faith, this savage Island blessed
 With its first bounty. Wandering through the west,
 Did holy Paul a while in Britain dwell,
 And call the Fountain forth by miracle,
 And with dread signs the nascent Stream invest?
 Or He, whose bonds dropped off, whose prison doors
 Flew open, by an Angel's voice unbarred? 
 Or some of humbler name, to these wild shores
 Storm-driven; who, having seen the cup of woe
 Pass from their Master, sojourned here to guard
 The precious Current they had taught to flow?
