---

 "Change me, some God, into that breathing rose!"
 The love-sick Stripling fancifully sighs,
 The envied flower beholding, as it lies
 On Laura's breast, in exquisite repose;
 Or he would pass into her bird, that throws
 The darts of song from out its wiry cage;
 Enraptured, could he for himself engage
 The thousandth part of what the Nymph bestows;
 And what the little careless innocent
 Ungraciously receives. Too daring choice!
 There are whose calmer mind it would content
 To be an unculled floweret of the glen,
 Fearless of plough and scythe; or darkling wren
 That tunes on Duddon's banks her slender voice.
