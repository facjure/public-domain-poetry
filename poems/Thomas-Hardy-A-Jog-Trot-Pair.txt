Who were the twain that trod this track
So many times together
 Hither and back,
In spells of certain and uncertain weather?

Commonplace in conduct they
Who wandered to and fro here
 Day by day:
Two that few dwellers troubled themselves to know here.

The very gravel-path was prim
That daily they would follow:
 Borders trim:
Never a wayward sprout, or hump, or hollow.

Trite usages in tamest style
Had tended to their plighting.
 "It's just worth while,
Perhaps," they had said. "And saves much sad good-nighting."

And petty seemed the happenings
That ministered to their joyance:
 Simple things,
Onerous to satiate souls, increased their buoyance.

Who could those common people be,
Of days the plainest, barest?
 They were we;
Yes; happier than the cleverest, smartest, rarest.
