'Twas a Funny Little Fellow
 Of the very purest type,
For he had a heart as mellow
 As an apple over-ripe;
And the brightest little twinkle
 When a funny thing occurred,
And the lightest little tinkle
 Of a laugh you ever heard!

His smile was like the glitter
 Of the sun in tropic lands,
And his talk a sweeter twitter
 Than the swallow understands;
Hear him sing - and tell a story -
 Snap a joke - ignite a pun, -
'Twas a capture - rapture - glory,
 And explosion - all in one!

Though he hadn't any money -
 That condiment which tends
To make a fellow "honey"
 For the palate of his friends; -
Sweet simples he compounded -
 Sovereign antidotes for sin
Or taint, - a faith unbounded
 That his friends were genuine.

He wasn't honored, may be -
 For his songs of praise were slim, -
Yet I never knew a baby
 That wouldn't crow for him;
I never knew a mother
 But urged a kindly claim
Upon him as a brother,
 At the mention of his name.

The sick have ceased their sighing
 And have even found the grace
Of a smile when they were dying
 As they looked upon his face;
And I've seen his eyes of laughter
 Melt in tears that only ran
As though, swift dancing after,
 Came the Funny Little Man.

He laughed away the sorrow,
 And he laughed away the gloom
We are all so prone to borrow
 From the darkness of the tomb;
And he laughed across the ocean
 Of a happy life, and passed,
With a laugh of glad emotion,
 Into Paradise at last.

And I think the Angels knew him,
 And had gathered to await
His coming, and run to him
 Through the widely-opened Gate -
With their faces gleaming sunny
 For his laughter-loving sake,
And thinking, "What a funny
 Little Angel he will make!"
