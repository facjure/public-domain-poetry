title: Blest Statesman He, Whose Mind's Unselfish Will
---

 Blest Statesman He, whose Mind's unselfish will
 Leaves him at ease among grand thoughts: whose eye
 Sees that, apart from magnanimity,
 Wisdom exists not; nor the humbler skill
 Of Prudence, disentangling good and ill
 With patient care. What tho' assaults run high,
 They daunt not him who holds his ministry,
 Resolute, at all hazards, to fulfil
 Its duties; prompt to move, but firm to wait,
 Knowing, things rashly sought are rarely found;
 That, for the functions of an ancient State
 Strong by her charters, free because imbound,
 Servant of Providence, not slave of Fate
 Perilous is sweeping change, all chance unsound.
