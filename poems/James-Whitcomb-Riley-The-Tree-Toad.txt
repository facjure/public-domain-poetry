 "'Scurious-like," said the tree-toad,
"I've twittered far rain all day;
 And I got up soon,
 And I hollered till noon -
But the sun, hit blazed away,
 Till I jest clumb down in a crawfish-hole,
 Weary at heart, and sick at soul!

"Dozed away far an hour,
 And I tackled the thing agin;
And I sung, and sung,
Till I knowed my lung
 Was jest about give in;
And then, thinks I, ef hit don't rain now.
There're nothin' in singin', anyhow!

 "Once in awhile some
Would come a drivin' past;
 And he'd hear my cry,
 And stop and sigh -
Till I jest laid back, at last,
 And I hollered rain till I thought my th'oat
 Would bust right open at ever' note!

 "But I fetched her! O I fetched her! -
'Cause a little while ago,
 As I kindo' set,
 With one eye shet,
And a-singin' soft and low,
 A voice drapped down on my fevered brain,
 Sayin', - ' Ef you'll jest hush I'll rain!'"
