title: Composed At Rydal On May Morning

 If with old love of you, dear Hills! I share
 New love of many a rival image brought
 From far, forgive the wanderings of my thought:
 Nor art thou wronged, sweet May! when I compare
 Thy present birth-morn with thy last, so fair,
 So rich to me in favours. For my lot
 Then was, within the famed Egerian Grot
 To sit and muse, fanned by its dewy air
 Mingling with thy soft breath! That morning too,
 Warblers I heard their joy unbosoming
 Amid the sunny, shadowy, Coliseum;
 Heard them, unchecked by aught of saddening hue,
 For victories there won by flower-crowned Spring,
 Chant in full choir their innocent Te Deum.
