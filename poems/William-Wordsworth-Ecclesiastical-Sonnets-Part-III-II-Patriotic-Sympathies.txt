 Last night, without a voice, that Vision spake
 Fear to my Soul, and sadness which might seem
 Wholly dissevered from our present theme;
 Yet, my beloved Country! I partake
 Of kindred agitations for thy sake;
 Thou, too, dost visit oft my midnight dream;
 Thy glory meets me with the earliest beam
 Of light, which tells that Morning is awake.
 If aught impair thy beauty or destroy,
 Or but forebode destruction, I deplore
 With filial love the sad vicissitude;
 If thou hast fallen, and righteous Heaven restore
 The prostrate, then my spring-time is renewed,
 And sorrow bartered for exceeding joy.
