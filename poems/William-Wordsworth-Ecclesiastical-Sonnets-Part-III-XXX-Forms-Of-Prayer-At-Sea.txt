 To kneeling Worshipers no earthly floor
 Gives holier invitation than the deck
 Of a storm-shattered Vessel saved from Wreck
 (When all that Man could do availed no more)
 By him who raised the Tempest and restrains:
 Happy the crew who this have felt, and pour
 Forth for his mercy, as the Church ordains,
 Solemn thanksgiving. Nor will 'they' implore
 In vain who, for a rightful cause, give breath
 To words the Church prescribes aiding the lip
 For the heart's sake, ere ship with hostile ship
 Encounters, armed for work of pain and death.
 Suppliants! the God to whom your cause ye trust
 Will listen, and ye know that He is just.
