title: The Deserted House

I.

Life and Thought have gone away
Side by side,
Leaving door and windows wide;
Careless tenants they!

 

II.

All within is dark as night:
In the windows is no light;
And no murmur at the door,
So frequent on its hinge before.

 

III.

Close the door, the shutters close,
Or thro� the windows we shall see
The nakedness and vacancy
Of the dark deserted house.

 

IV.

Come away; no more of mirth
Is here or merry-making sound.
The house was builded of the earth,
And shall fall again to ground.

 

V.

Come away; for Life and Thought
Here no longer dwell,
But in a city glorious�
A great and distant city�have bought
A mansion incorruptible.
Would they could have stayed with us!
