 Why did you flutter in vain hope, poor bird,
Hard-pressed in your small cage of clay?
 'Twas but a sweet, false echo that you heard,
Caught only a feint of day.

 Still is the night all dark, a homeless dark.
Burn yet the unanswering stars. And silence brings
 The same sea's desolate surge - sans bound or mark - 
Of all your wanderings.

 Fret now no more; be still. Those steadfast eyes,
Those folded hands, they cannot set you free;
 Only with beauty wake wild memories - 
Sorrow for where you are, for where you would be.
