 The Bard, whose soul is meek as dawning day,
 Yet trained to judgments righteously severe,
 Fervid, yet conversant with holy fear,
 As recognising one Almighty sway:
 He, whose experienced eye can pierce the array
 Of past events; to whom, in vision clear,
 The aspiring heads of future things appear,
 Like mountain-tops whose mists have rolled away
 Assoiled from all encumbrance of our time,
 He only, if such breathe, in strains devout
 Shall comprehend this victory sublime;
 Shall worthily rehearse the hideous rout,
 The triumph hail, which from their peaceful clime
 Angels might welcome with a choral shout!
