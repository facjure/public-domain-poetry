title: As It Was In The Beginning
---

As it was in the beginning, so we�ll find it in the end,
For a lover, or a brother, or a sweetheart, or a friend;
As it was in the beginning, so we�ll find it by-and-bye,
When weak women hug their babies, and strong men go out to die.

As �tis written now, or spoken, so we�ll find it yet in deed, 
For their State, or for their Country, for their Honour or their Creed;
For the love of Right, or hatred for the Everlasting Lie,
When the women think of some things, and strong men go out to die.

As it used to be in past times, in the future so it must,
We shall find him stretching forward with his face down in the dust,
All his wounds in front, and hidden, blood to earth, and back to sky,
When pale women pray in private, and strong men go out to die.

Rebels all we are, and brothers, rebels to the laws we make, 
Rich or poor, or fat or lean man, fighting for another�s sake;
It is all as God decreed it, we shall find it by-and-bye,
When our girls, disguised in boys� clothes, go to die where strong men die.
