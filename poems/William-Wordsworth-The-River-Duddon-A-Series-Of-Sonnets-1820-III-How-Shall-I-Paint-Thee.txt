---

 How shall I paint thee? Be this naked stone
 My seat, while I give way to such intent;
 Pleased could my verse, a speaking monument,
 Make to the eyes of men thy features known.
 But as of all those tripping lambs not one
 Outruns his fellows, so hath Nature lent
 To thy beginning nought that doth present
 Peculiar ground for hope to build upon.
 To dignify the spot that gives thee birth,
 No sign of hoar Antiquity's esteem
 Appears, and none of modern Fortune's care;
 Yet thou thyself hast round thee shed a gleam
 Of brilliant moss, instinct with freshness rare;
 Prompt offering to thy Foster-mother, Earth!
