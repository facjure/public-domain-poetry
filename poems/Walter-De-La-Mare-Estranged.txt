 No one was with me there - 
 Happy I was - alone;
 Yet from the sunshine suddenly
A joy was gone.

 A bird in an empty house
 Sad echoes makes to ring,
 Flitting from room to room
On restless wing:

 Till from its shades he flies,
 And leaves forlorn and dim
 The narrow solitudes
So strange to him.

 So, when with fickle heart
 I joyed in the passing day,
 A presence my mood estranged
Went grieved away.
