 When I too long have looked upon your face,
 Wherein for me a brightness unobscured
 Save by the mists of brightness has its place,
 And terrible beauty not to be endured,
 I turn away reluctant from your light,
 And stand irresolute, a mind undone,
 A silly, dazzled thing deprived of sight
 From having looked too long upon the sun.
 Then is my daily life a narrow room
 In which a little while, uncertainly,
 Surrounded by impenetrable gloom,
 Among familiar things grown strange to me
 Making my way, I pause, and feel, and hark,
 Till I become accustomed to the dark.
