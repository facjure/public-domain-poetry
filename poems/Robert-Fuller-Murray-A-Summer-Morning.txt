title: A Summer Morning
---

Never was sun so bright before,
 No matin of the lark so sweet,
 No grass so green beneath my feet,
Nor with such dewdrops jewelled o'er.

I stand with thee outside the door,
 The air not yet is close with heat,
 And far across the yellowing wheat
The waves are breaking on the shore.

A lovely day!Yet many such,
 Each like to each, this month have passed,
And none did so supremely shine.
One thing they lacked: the perfect touch
 Of thee--and thou art come at last,
And half this loveliness is thine.
