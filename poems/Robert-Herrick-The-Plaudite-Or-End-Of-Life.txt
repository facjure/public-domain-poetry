If after rude and boisterous seas
My wearied pinnace here finds ease;
If so it be I've gain'd the shore,
With safety of a faithful oar;
If having run my barque on ground,
Ye see the aged vessel crown'd;
What's to be done?but on the sands
Ye dance and sing, and now clap hands.
The first act's doubtful, but (we say)
It is the last commends the Play.
