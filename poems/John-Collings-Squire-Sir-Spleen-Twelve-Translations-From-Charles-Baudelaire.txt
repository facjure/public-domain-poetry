 When the low heavy sky weighs like a lid
 Upon the spirit aching for the light
 And all the wide horizon's line is hid
 By a black day sadder than any night;

 When the changed earth is but a dungeon dank
 Where batlike Hope goes blindly fluttering
 And, striking wall and roof and mouldered plank,
 Bruises his tender head and timid wing;

 When like grim prison-bars stretch down the thin,
 Straight, rigid pillars of the endless rain,
 And the dumb throngs of infamous spiders spin
 Their meshes in the caverns of the brain;, 

 Suddenly, bells leap forth into the air,
 Hurling a hideous uproar to the sky
 As 'twere a band of homeless spirits who fare
 Through the strange heavens, wailing stubbornly.

 And hearses, without drum or instrument,
 File slowly through my soul; crushed, sorrowful,
 Weeps Hope, and Grief, fierce and omnipotent,
 Plants his black banner on my drooping skull.
