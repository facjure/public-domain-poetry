title: Composed Among The Ruins Of A Castle In North Wales
---

 Through shattered galleries, 'mid roofless halls,
 Wandering with timid footsteps oft betrayed,
 The Stranger sighs, nor scruples to upbraid
 Old Time, though he, gentlest among the Thralls
 Of Destiny, upon these wounds hath laid
 His lenient touches, soft as light that falls,
 From the wan Moon, upon the towers and walls,
 Light deepening the profoundest sleep of shade.
 Relic of Kings! Wreck of forgotten wars,
 To winds abandoned and the prying stars,
 Time 'loves' Thee! at his call the Seasons twine
 Luxuriant wreaths around thy forehead hoar;
 And, though past pomp no changes can restore,
 A soothing recompense, his gift, is thine!
