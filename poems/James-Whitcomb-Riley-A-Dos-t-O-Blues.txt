 I' got no patience with blues at all!
And I ust to kindo talk
 Aginst 'em, and claim, 'tel along last Fall,
They was none in the fambly stock;
 But a nephew of mine, from Eelinoy,
That visited us last year,
 He kindo convinct me differunt
While he was a-stayin' here.

 Frum ever'-which way that blues is from,
They'd tackle him ever' ways;
 They'd come to him in the night, and come
On Sundays, and rainy days;
 They'd tackle him in corn-plantin' time,
And in harvest, and airly Fall,
 But a dose 't of blues in the wintertime,
He 'lowed, was the worst of all!

 Said all diseases that ever he had -
The mumps, er the rheumatiz -
 Er ever'-other-day-aigger's bad
Purt' nigh as anything is! -
 Er a cyarbuncle, say, on the back of his neck,
Er a felon on his thumb, -
 But you keep the blues away from him,
And all o' the rest could come!

 And he'd moan, "They's nary a leaf below!
Ner a spear o' grass in sight!
 And the whole wood-pile's clean under snow!
And the days is dark as night!
 You can't go out - ner you can't stay in -
Lay down - stand up - ner set!"
 And a tetch o' regular tyfoid-blues
Would double him jest clean shet!

 I writ his parents a postal-kyard,
He could stay 'tel Spring-time come;
 And Aprile first, as I rickollect,
Was the day we shipped him home!
 Most o' his relatives, sence then,
Has either give up, er quit,
 Er jest died off; but I understand
He's the same old color yit!
