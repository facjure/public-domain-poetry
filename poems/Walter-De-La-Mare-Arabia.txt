 Far are the shades of Arabia,
 Where the Princes ride at noon,
 'Mid the verdurous vales and thickets,
 Under the ghost of the moon;
 And so dark is that vaulted purple
 Flowers in the forest rise
 And toss into blossom 'gainst the phantom stars
 Pale in the noonday skies.

 Sweet is the music of Arabia
 In my heart, when out of dreams
 I still in the thin clear mirk of dawn
 Descry her gliding streams;
 Hear her strange lutes on the green banks
 Ring loud with the grief and delight
 Of the dim-silked, dark-haired Musicians
 In the brooding silence of night.

 They haunt me - her lutes and her forests;
 No beauty on earth I see
 But shadowed with that dream recalls
 Her loveliness to me:
 Still eyes look coldly upon me,
 Cold voices whisper and say - 
 'He is crazed with the spell of far Arabia,
 They have stolen his wits away.'
