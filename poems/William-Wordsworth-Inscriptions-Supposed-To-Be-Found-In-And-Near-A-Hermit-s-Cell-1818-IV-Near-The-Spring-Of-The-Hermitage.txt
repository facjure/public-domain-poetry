 Troubled long with warring notions
 Long impatient of thy rod,
 I resign my soul's emotions
 Unto Thee, mysterious God!

 What avails the kindly shelter
 Yielded by this craggy rent,
 If my spirit toss and welter
 On the waves of discontent?

 Parching Summer hath no warrant
 To consume this crystal Well;
 Rains, that make each rill a torrent,
 Neither sully it nor swell.

 Thus, dishonouring not her station,
 Would my Life present to Thee,
 Gracious God, the pure oblation
 Of divine tranquillity!
