�Whither, O whither, love, shall we go,
For a score of sweet little summers or so?�
The sweet little wife of the singer said,
On the day that follow�d the day she was wed,
�Whither, O whither, love, shall we go?�
And the singer shaking his curly head
Turn�d as he sat, and struck the keys
There at his right with a sudden crash,
Singing, �And shall it be over the seas
With a crew that is neither rude nor rash,
But a bevy of Eroses apple-cheek�d,
In a shallop of crystal ivory-beak�d?
With a satin sail of a ruby glow,
To a sweet little Eden on earth that I know,
A mountain islet pointed and peak�d;
Waves on a diamond shingle dash,
Cataract brooks to the ocean run,
Fairily-delicate palaces shine
Mixt with myrtle and clad with vine,
And overstream�d and silvery-streak�d
With many a rivulet high against the sun
The facets of the glorious mountain flash
Above the valleys of palm and pine.�

�Thither, O thither, love, let us go.�

�No, no, no!
For in all that exquisite isle, my dear,
There is but one bird with a musical throat,
And his compass is but of a single note,
That it makes one weary to hear.�

�Mock me not! mock me not! love, let us go.�

�No, love, no.
For the bud ever breaks into bloom on the tree,
And a storm never wakes on the lonely sea,
And a worm is there in the lonely wood,
That pierces the liver and blackens the blood,
And makes it a sorrow to be.�
