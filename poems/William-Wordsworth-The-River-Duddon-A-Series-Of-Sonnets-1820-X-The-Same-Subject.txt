 Not so that Pair whose youthful spirits dance
 With prompt emotion, urging them to pass;
 A sweet confusion checks the Shepherd-lass;
 Blushing she eyes the dizzy flood askance;
 To stop ashamed, too timid to advance;
 She ventures once again, another pause!
 His outstretched hand He tauntingly withdraws
 She sues for help with piteous utterance!
 Chidden she chides again; the thrilling touch
 Both feel, when he renews the wished-for aid:
 Ah! if their fluttering hearts should stir too much,
 Should beat too strongly, both may be betrayed.
 The frolic Loves, who, from yon high rock, see
 The struggle, clap their wings for victory!
