title: On The Frith Of Clyde - In A Steamboat

 Arran! a single-crested Teneriffe,
 A St. Helena next in shape and hue,
 Varying her crowded peaks and ridges blue;
 Who but must covet a cloud-seat, or skiff
 Built for the air, or winged Hippogriff?
 That he might fly, where no one could pursue,
 From this dull Monster and her sooty crew;
 And, as a God, light on thy topmost cliff.
 Impotent wish! which reason would despise
 If the mind knew no union of extremes,
 No natural bond between the boldest schemes,
 Ambition frames, and heart-humilities.
 Beneath stern mountains many a soft vale lies,
 And lofty springs give birth to lowly streams.
