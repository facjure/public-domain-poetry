title: Sonnets � I - Desponding Father! Mark This Altered Bough,
---

 Desponding Father! mark this altered bough,
 So beautiful of late, with sunshine warmed,
 Or moist with dews; what more unsightly now,
 Its blossoms shriveled, and its fruit, if formed,
 Invisible? yet Spring her genial brow
 Knits not o'er that discolouring and decay
 As false to expectation. Nor fret thou
 At like unlovely process in the May
 Of human life: a Stripling's graces blow,
 Fade and are shed, that from their timely fall
 (Misdeem it not a cankerous change) may grow
 Rich mellow bearings, that for thanks shall call:
 In all men, sinful is it to be slow
 To hope in Parents, sinful above all.
