 By chance my fingers, resting on my face,
Stayed suddenly where in its orbit shone
The lamp of all things beautiful; then on,
 Following more heedfully, did softly trace
 Each arch and prominence and hollow place
That shall revealed be when all else is gone - 
Warmth, colour, roundness - to oblivion,
 And nothing left but darkness and disgrace.

 Life like a moment passed seemed then to be;
A transient dream this raiment that it wore;
 While spelled my hand out its mortality
Made certain all that had seemed doubt before:
 Proved - O how vaguely, yet how lucidly! - 
How much death does; and yet can do no more.
