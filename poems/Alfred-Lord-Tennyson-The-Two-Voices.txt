title: The Two Voices
---

A still small voice spake unto me,
�Thou art so full of misery,
Were it not better not to be?�

Then to the still small voice I said;
�Let me not cast in endless shade
What is so wonderfully made.�

To which the voice did urge reply;
�To-day I saw the dragon-fly
Come from the wells where he did lie.

�An inner impulse rent the veil
Of his old husk: from head to tail
Came out clear plates of sapphire mail.

�He dried his wings: like gauze they grew;
Thro� crofts and pastures wet with dew
A living flash of light he flew.�

I said, �When first the world began,
Young Nature thro� five cycles ran,
And in the sixth she moulded man.

�She gave him mind, the lordliest
Proportion, and, above the rest,
Dominion in the head and breast.�

Thereto the silent voice replied;
�Self-blinded are you by your pride:
Look up thro� night: the world is wide.

�This truth within thy mind rehearse,
That in a boundless universe
Is boundless better, boundless worse.

�Think you this mould of hopes and fears
Could find no statelier than his peers
In yonder hundred million spheres?�

It spake, moreover, in my mind:
�Tho� thou wert scatter�d to the wind,
Yet is there plenty of the kind.�

Then did my response clearer fall:
�No compound of this earthly ball
Is like another, all in all.�

To which he answer�d scoffingly;
�Good soul! suppose I grant it thee,
Who�ll weep for thy deficiency?

�Or will one beam be less intense,
When thy peculiar differenee
Is cancell�d in the world of sense?�

I would have said, �Thou canst not know,�
But my full heart, that work�d below,
Rain�d thro� my sight its overflow.

Again the voice spake unto me:
�Thou art so steep�d in misery,
Surely �twere better not to be.

�Thine anguish will not let thee sleep,
Nor any train of reason keep:
Thou canst not think, but thou wilt weep.�

I said, �The years with change advance:
If I make dark my countenance,
I shut my life from happier chance.

�Some turn this sickness yet might take,
Ev�n yet.� But he: �What drug can make
A wither�d palsy cease to shake?�

I wept, �Tho� I should die, I know
That all about the thorn will blow
In tufts of rosy-tinted snow;

�And men, thro� novel spheres of thought
Still moving after truth long sought,
Will learn new things when I am not.�

�Yet,� said the secret voice, �some time,
Sooner or later, will gray prime
Make thy grass hoar with early rime.

�Not less swift souls that yearn for light,
Rapt after heaven�s starry flight,
Would sweep the tracts of day and night.

�Not less the bee would range her cells,
The furzy prickle fire the dells,
The foxglove cluster dappled bells.�

I said that �all the years invent;
Each month is various to present
The world with some development.

�Were this not well, to bide mine hour,
Tho� watching from a ruin�d tower
How grows the day of human power?�

�The highest-mounted mind,� he said,
�Still sees the sacred morning spread
The silent summit overhead.

�Will thirty seasons render plain
Those lonely lights that still remain,
Just breaking over land and main?

�Or make that morn, from his cold crown
And crystal silence creeping down,
Flood with full daylight glebe and town?

�Forerun thy peers, thy time, and let
Thy feet, millenniums hence, be set
In midst of knowledge, dream�d not yet.

�Thou hast not gain�d a real height,
Nor art thou nearer to the light,
Because the scale is infinite.

��Twere better not to breathe or speak,
Than cry for strength, remaining weak,
And seem to find, but still to seek.

�Moreover, but to seem to find
Asks what thou lackest, thought resign�d,
A healthy frame, a quiet mind.�

I said, �When I am gone away,
�He dared not tarry,� men will say,
Doing dishonour to my clay.�

�This is more vile,� he made reply,
�To breathe and loathe, to live and sigh,
Than once from dread of pain to die.

�Sick art thou�a divided will
Still heaping on the fear of ill
The fear of men, a coward still.

�Do men love thee? Art thou so bound
To men, that how thy name may sound
Will vex thee lying underground?

�The memory of the wither�d leaf
In endless time is scarce more brief
Than of the garner�d Autumn-sheaf.

�Go, vexed Spirit, sleep in trust;
The right ear, that is fill�d with dust,
Hears little of the false or just.�

�Hard task, to pluck resolve,� I cried,
�From emptiness and the waste wide
Of that abyss, or scornful pride!

�Nay�rather yet that I could raise
One hope that warm�d me in the days
While still I yearn�d for human praise.

�When, wide in soul and bold of tongue,
Among the tents I paused and sung,
The distant battle flash�d and rung.

�I sung the joyful P�an clear,
And, sitting, burnish�d without fear
The brand, the buckler, and the spear�

�Waiting to strive a happy strife,
To war with falsehood to the knife,
And not to lose the good of life�

�Some hidden principle to move,
To put together, part and prove,
And mete the bounds of hate and love�

�As far as might be, to carve out
Free space for every human doubt,
That the whole mind might orb about�

�To search thro� all I felt or saw,
The springs of life, the depths of awe,
And reach the law within the law:

�At least, not rotting like a weed,
But, having sown some generous seed,
Fruitful of further thought and deed,

�To pass, when Life her light withdraws,
Not void of righteous self-applause,
Nor in a merely selfish cause�

�In some good cause, not in mine own,
To perish, wept for, honour�d, known,
And like a warrior overthrown;

�Whose eyes are dim with glorious tears,
When, soil�d with noble dust, he hears
His country�s war-song thrill his ears:

�Then dying of a mortal stroke,
What time the foeman�s line is broke,
And all the war is roll�d in smoke.�

�Yea!� said the voice, �thy dream was good,
While thou abodest in the bud.
It was the stirring of the blood.

�If Nature put not forth her power
About the opening of the flower,
Who is it that could live an hour?

�Then comes the check, the change, the fall,
Pain rises up, old pleasures pall.
There is one remedy for all.

�Yet hadst thou, thro� enduring pain,
Link�d month to month with such a chain
Of knitted purport, all were vain.

�Thou hadst not between death and birth
Dissolved the riddle of the earth.
So were thy labour little-worth.

�That men with knowledge merely play�d,
I told thee�hardly nigher made,
Tho� scaling slow from grade to grade;

�Much less this dreamer, deaf and blind,
Named man, may hope some truth to find,
That bears relation to the mind.

�For every worm beneath the moon
Draws different threads, and late and soon
Spins, toiling out his own cocoon.

�Cry, faint not: either Truth is born
Beyond the polar gleam forlorn,
Or in the gateways of the morn.

�Cry, faint not, climb: the summits slope
Beyond the furthest flights of hope,
Wrapt in dense cloud from base to cope.

�Sometimes a little corner shines,
As over rainy mist inclines
A gleaming crag with belts of pines.

�I will go forward, sayest thou,
I shall not fail to find her now.
Look up, the fold is on her brow.

�If straight thy track, or if oblique,
Thou know�st not. Shadows thou dost strike,
Embracing cloud, Ixion-like;

�And owning but a little more
Than beasts, abidest lame and poor,
Calling thyself a little lower

�Than angels. Cease to wail and brawl!
Why inch by inch to darkness crawl?
There is one remedy for all.�

�O dull, one-sided voice,� said I,
�Wilt thou make everything a lie,
To flatter me that I may die?

�I know that age to age succeeds,
Blowing a noise of tongues and deeds,
A dust of systems and of creeds.

�I cannot hide that some have striven,
Achieving calm, to whom was given
The joy that mixes man with Heaven:

�Who, rowing hard against the stream,
Saw distant gates of Eden gleam,
And did not dream it was a dream;

�But heard, by secret transport led,
Ev�n in the charnels of the dead,
The murmur of the fountain-head�

�Which did accomplish their desire,
Bore and forebore, and did not tire,
Like Stephen, an unquenched fire.

�He heeded not reviling tones,
Nor sold his heart to idle moans,
Tho� cursed and scorn�d, and bruised with stones:

�But looking upward, full of grace,
He pray�d, and from a happy place
God's glory smote him on the face.�

The sullen answer slid betwixt:
�Not that the grounds of hope were fix�d,
The elements were kindlier mix�d.�

I said, �I toil beneath the curse,
But, knowing not the universe,
I fear to slide from bad to worse.

�And that, in seeking to undo
One riddle, and to find the true,
I knit a hundred others new:

�Or that this anguish fleeting hence,
Unmanacled from bonds of sense,
Be fix�d and froz�n to permanence:

�For I go, weak from suffering here:
Naked I go, and void of cheer:
What is it that I may not fear?�

�Consider well,� the voice replied,
�His face, that two hours since hath died;
Wilt thou find passion, pain or pride?

�Will he obey when one commands?
Or answer should one press his hands?
He answers not, nor understands.

�His palms are folded on his breast:
There is no other thing express�d
But long disquiet merged in rest.

�His lips are very mild and meek:
Tho� one should smite him on the cheek,
And on the mouth, he will not speak.

�His little daughter, whose sweet face
He kiss�d, taking his last embrace,
Becomes dishonour to her race�

�His sons grow up that bear his name,
Some grow to honour, some to shame,�
But he is chill to praise or blame.

�He will not hear the north-wind rave,
Nor, moaning, household shelter crave
From winter rains that beat his grave.

�High up the vapours fold and swim:
About him broods the twilight dim:
The place he knew forgetteth him.�

�If all he dark, vague voice,� I said,
�These things are wrapt in doubt and dread,
Nor canst thou show the dead are dead.

�The sap dries up: the plant declines.
A deeper tale my heart divines.
Know I not Death? the outward signs?

�I found him when my years were few;
A shadow on the graves I knew,
And darkness in the village yew.

�From grave to grave the shadow crept:
In her still place the morning wept:
Touch�d by his feet the daisy slept.

�The simple senses crown�d his head:
�Omega! thou art Lord,� they said,
�We find no motion in the dead.�

�Why, if man rot in dreamless ease,
Should that plain fact, as taught by these,
Not make him sure that he shall cease?

�Who forged that other influence,
That heat of inward evidence,
By which he doubts against the sense?

�He owns the fatal gift of eyes,
That read his spirit blindly wise,
Not simple as a thing that dies.

�Here sits he shaping wings to fly:
His heart forebodes a mystery:
He names the name Eternity.

�That type of Perfect in his mind
In Nature can he nowhere find.
He sows himself on every wind.

�He seems to hear a Heavenly Friend,
And thro� thick veils to apprehend
A labour working to an end.

�The end and the beginning vex
His reason: many things perplex,
With motions, checks, and counterchecks.

�He knows a baseness in his blood
At such strange war with something good,
He may not do the thing he would.

�Heaven opens inward, chasms yawn,
Vast images in glimmering dawn,
Half shown, are broken and withdrawn.

�Ah! sure within him and without,
Could his dark wisdom find it out,
There must be answer to his doubt,

�But thou canst answer not again.
With thine own weapon art thou slain,
Or thou wilt answer but in vain.

�The doubt would rest, I dare not solve.
In the same circle we revolve.
Assurance only breeds resolve.�

As when a billow, blown against,
Falls back, the voice with which I fenced
A little ceased, but recommenced.

�Where wert thou when thy father play�d
In his free field, and pastime made,
A merry boy in sun and shade?

�A merry boy they call�d him then,
He sat upon the knees of men
In days that never come again.

�Before the little ducts began
To feed thy bones with lime, and ran
Their course, till thou wert also man:

�Who took a wife, who rear�d his race,
Whose wrinkles gather�d on his face,
Whose troubles number with his days:

�A life of nothings, nothing-worth,
From that first nothing ere his birth
To that last nothing under earth!�

�These words,� I said, �are like the rest;
No certain clearness, but at best
A vague suspicion of the breast:

�But if I grant, thou mightst defend
The thesis which thy words intend�
That to begin implies to end;

�Yet how should I for certain hold,
Because my memory is so cold,
That I first was in human mould?

�I cannot make this matter plain,
But I would shoot, howe�er in vain,
A random arrow from the brain.

�It may be that no life is found,
Which only to one engine bound
Falls off, but cycles always round.

�As old mythologies relate,
Some draught of Lethe might await
The slipping thro� from state to state.

�As here we find in trances, men
Forget the dream that happens then,
Until they fall in trance again.

�So might we, if our state were such
As one before, remember much,
For those two likes might meet and touch.

�But, if I lapsed from nobler place,
Some legend of a fallen race
Alone might hint of my disgrace;

�Some vague emotion of delight
In gazing up an Alpine height,
Some yeaming toward the lamps of night;

�Or if thro� lower lives I came�
Tho� all experience past became
Consolidate in mind and frame�

�I might forget my weaker lot;
For is not our first year forgot?
The haunts of memory echo not.

�And men, whose reason long was blind,
From cells of madness unconfined,
Oft lose whole years of darker mind.

�Much more, if first I floated free,
As naked essence, must I be
Incompetent of memory:

�For memory dealing but with time,
And he with matter, could she climb
Beyond her own material prime?

�Moreover, something is or seems,
That touches me with mystic gleams,
Like glimpses of forgotten dreams�

�Of something felt, like something here;
Of something done, I know not where;
Such as no language may declare.�

The still voice laugh�d. �I talk,� said he,
�Not with thy dreams. Suffice it thee
Thy pain is a reality.�

�But thou,� said I, �hast missed thy mark,
Who sought�st to wreck my mortal ark,
By making all the horizon dark.

�Why not set forth, if I should do
This rashness, that which might ensue
With this old soul in organs new?

�Whatever crazy sorrow saith,
No life that breathes with human breath
Has ever truly long�d for death.

��Tis life, whereof our nerves are scant,
Oh life, not death, for which we pant;
More life, and fuller, that I want.�

I ceased, and sat as one forlorn.
Then said the voice, in quiet scorn,
�Behold, it is the Sabbath morn.�

And I arose, and I released
The casement, and the light increased
With freshness in the dawning east.

Like soften�d airs that blowing steal,
When meres begin to uncongeal,
The sweet church bells began to peal.

On to God�s house the people prest:
Passing the place where each must rest,
Each enter�d like a welcome guest.

One walk�d between his wife and child,
With measured footfall firm and mild,
And now and then he gravely smiled.

The prudent partner of his blood
Lean�d on him, faithful, gentle, good,
Wearing the rose of womanhood.

And in their double love secure,
The little maiden walk�d demure,
Pacing with downward eyelids pure.

These three made unity so sweet,
My frozen heart began to beat,
Remembering its ancient heat.

I blest them, and they wander�d on:
I spoke, but answer came there none:
The dull and bitter voice was gone.

A second voice was at mine ear,
A little whisper silver-clear,
A murmur, �Be of better cheer.�

As from some blissful neighbourhood,
A notice faintly understood,
�I see the end, and know the good.�

A little hint to solace woe,
A hint, a whisper breathing low,
�I may not speak of what I know.�

Like an �olian harp that wakes
No certain air, but overtakes
Far thought with music that it makes:

Such seem�d the whisper at my side:
�What is it thou knowest, sweet voice?� I cried.
�A hidden hope,� the voice replied:

So heavenly-toned, that in that hour
From out my sullen heart a power
Broke, like the rainbow from the shower,

To feel, altho� no tongue can prove,
That every cloud, that spreads above
And veileth love, itself is love.

And forth into the fields I went,
And Nature�s living motion lent
The pulse of hope to discontent.

I wonder�d at the bounteous hours,
The slow result of winter showers:
You scarce could see the grass for flowers.

I wonder�d, while I paced along:
The woods were fill�d so full with song,
There seem�d no room for sense of wrong;

And all so variously wrought,
I marvell�d how the mind was brought
To anchor by one gloomy thought;

And wherefore rather I made choice
To commune with that barren voice,
Than him that said, �Rejoice! Rejoice!�
