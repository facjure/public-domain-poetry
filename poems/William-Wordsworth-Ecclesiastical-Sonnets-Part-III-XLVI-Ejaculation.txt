 Glory to God! and to the Power who came
 In filial duty, clothed with love divine,
 That made his human tabernacle shine
 Like Ocean burning with purpureal flame;
 Or like the Alpine Mount, that takes its name
 From roseate hues, far kenned at morn and even
 In hours of peace, or when the storm is driven
 Along the nether region's rugged frame!
 Earth prompts, Heaven urges; let us seek the light,
 Studious of that pure intercourse begun
 When first our infant brows their lustre won;
 So, like the Mountain, may we grow more bright
 From unimpeded commerce with the Sun,
 At the approach of all-involving night.
