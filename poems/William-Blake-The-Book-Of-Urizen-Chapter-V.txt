1.

In terrors Los shrunk from his task:
His great hammer fell from his hand:
His fires beheld, and sickening,
Hid their strong limbs in smoke.
For with noises ruinous loud;
With hurtlings &amp; clashings &amp; groans
The Immortal endur'd his chains,
Tho' bound in a deadly sleep.

2.

All the myriads of Eternity:
All the wisdom &amp; joy of life:
Roll like a sea around him,
Except what his little orbs
Of sight by degrees unfold.

3.

And now his eternal life
Like a dream was obliterated

4.

Shudd'ring, the Eternal Prophet smote
With a stroke, from his north to south region
The bellows &amp; hammer are silent now
A nerveless silence, his prophetic voice
Siez'd; a cold solitude &amp; dark void
The Eternal Prophet &amp; Urizen clos'd

5.

Ages on ages rolld over them
Cut off from life &amp; light frozen
Into horrible forms of deformity
Los suffer'd his fires to decay
Then he look'd back with anxious desire
But the space undivided by existence
Struck horror into his soul.

6.

Los wept obscur'd with mourning:
His bosom earthquak'd with sighs;
He saw Urizen deadly black,
In his chains bound, &amp; Pity began,

7.

In anguish dividing &amp; dividing
For pity divides the soul
In pangs eternity on eternity
Life in cataracts pourd down his cliffs
The void shrunk the lymph into Nerves
Wand'ring wide on the bosom of night
And left a round globe of blood
Trembling upon the Void
Thus the Eternal Prophet was divided
Before the death-image of Urizen
For in changeable clouds and darkness
In a winterly night beneath,
The Abyss of Los stretch'd immense:
And now seen, now obscur'd, to the eyes
Of Eternals, the visions remote
Of the dark seperation appear'd.
As glasses discover Worlds
In the endless Abyss of space,
So the expanding eyes of Immortals
Beheld the dark visions of Los,
And the globe of life blood trembling

8.

The globe of life blood trembled
Branching out into roots;
Fib'rous, writhing upon the winds;
Fibres of blood, milk and tears;
In pangs, eternity on eternity.
At length in tears &amp; cries imbodied
A female form trembling and pale
Waves before his deathy face

9.

All Eternity shudderd at sight
Of the first female now separate
Pale as a cloud of snow
Waving before the face of Los

10.

Wonder, awe, fear, astonishment,
Petrify the eternal myriads;
At the first female form now separate
They call'd her Pity, and fled

11.

"Spread a Tent, with strong curtains around them
"Let cords &amp; stakes bind in the Void
That Eternals may no more behold them"

12.

They began to weave curtains of darkness
They erected large pillars round the Void
With golden hooks fastend in the pillars
With infinite labour the Eternals
A woof wove, and called it Science
