 Not envying Latian shades, if yet they throw
 A grateful coolness round that crystal Spring,
 Blandusia, prattling as when long ago
 The Sabine Bard was moved her praise to sing;
 Careless of flowers that in perennial blow
 Round the moist marge of Persian fountains cling;
 Heedless of Alpine torrents thundering
 Through ice-built arches radiant as heaven's bow;
 I seek the birthplace of a native Stream.
 All hail, ye mountains! hail, thou morning light!
 Better to breathe at large on this clear height
 Than toil in needless sleep from dream to dream:
 Pure flow the verse, pure, vigorous, free, and bright,
 For Duddon, long-loved Duddon, is my theme!
