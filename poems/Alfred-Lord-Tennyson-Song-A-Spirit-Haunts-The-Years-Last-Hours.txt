title: Song: �A Spirit Haunts The Year�s Last Hours
---

I.


A spirit haunts the year�s last hours
Dwelling amid these yellowing bowers:
To himself he talks;
For at eventide, listening earnestly,
At his work you may hear him sob and sigh
In the walks;
Earthward he boweth the heavy stalks
Of the mouldering flowers:
Heavily hangs the broad sunflower
Over its grave i� the earth so chilly;
Heavily hangs the hollyhock,
Heavily hangs the tiger-lily.

 

II.

The air is damp, and hush�d, and close,
As a sick man�s room when he taketh repose
An hour before death;
My very heart faints and my whole soul grieves
At the moist rich smell of the rotting leaves,
And the breath
Of the fading edges of box beneath,
And the year�s last rose.
Heavily hangs the broad sunflower
Over its grave i� the earth so chilly;
Heavily hangs the hollyhock,
Heavily hangs the tiger-lily.
