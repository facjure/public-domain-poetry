 Shame on this faithless heart! that could allow
 Such transport, though but for a moment's space;
 Not while, to aid the spirit of the place
 The crescent moon clove with its glittering prow
 The clouds, or night-bird sang from shady bough;
 But in plain daylight: She, too, at my side,
 Who, with her heart's experience satisfied,
 Maintains inviolate its slightest vow!
 Sweet Fancy! other gifts must I receive;
 Proofs of a higher sovereignty I claim;
 Take from 'her' brow the withering flowers of eve,
 And to that brow life's morning wreath restore;
 Let 'her' be comprehended in the frame
 Of these illusions, or they please no more.
