title: The Cats - (Twelve Translations From Charles Baudelaire)
---

 The lover and the stern philosopher
 Both love, in their ripe time, the confident
 Soft cats, the house's chiefest ornament,
 Who like themselves are cold and seldom stir.

 Of knowledge and of pleasure amorous,
 Silence they seek and Darkness' fell domain;
 Had not their proud souls scorned to brook his rein,
 They would have made grim steeds for Erebus.

 Pensive they rest in noble attitudes
 Like great stretched sphinxes in vast solitudes
 Which seem to sleep wrapt in an endless dream;

 Their fruitful loins are full of sparks divine,
 And gleams of gold within their pupils shine
 As 'twere within the shadow of a stream.
