 The saintly Youth has ceased to rule, discrowned
 By unrelenting Death. O People keen
 For change, to whom the new looks always green!
 Rejoicing did they cast upon the ground
 Their Gods of wood and stone; and, at the sound
 Of counter-proclamation, now are seen,
 (Proud triumph is it for a sullen Queen!)
 Lifting them up, the worship to confound
 Of the Most High. Again do they invoke
 The Creature, to the Creature glory give;
 Again with frankincense the altars smoke
 Like those the Heathen served; and mass is sung;
 And prayer, man's rational prerogative,
 Runs through blind channels of an unknown tongue.
