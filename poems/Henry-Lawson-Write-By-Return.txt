Clerk, corresponding,
�Rooster and Comb�,
Here I sit idle
�Thinking of home�;
I must be grafting,
Living to earn,
More correspondence,
�Write by return.�

Clerk in employ of
�Shoddy and Woods�,
Thinks that we have not
Forwarded goods.
Parcel we sent them,
Missing, I learn,
Says in his postscript:
�Write by return.�

Here is another
Letter from Bland,
�Cheque he expected
Isn�t to hand.�
How we forgot it
Cannot discern,
�Forward remittance,
Write by return.�

Here is another,
O how they come?
Treats of a �Bender�
Planned by a chum.
See on the margin,
Big letters: �Burn
After perusal,
Write by return.�

Mail in from England,
Letters for me,
Dear little sweetheart
Over the sea.
�Quite broken-hearted,
O how I yearn
Only to see you. . . .
Write by return.�

One who will �never
Think that I�m bad�
Writes me a letter
Tearful and sad.
Thinks that I�m starving,
Filled with concern,
Sends me some money,
�Write by return.�

Letter from father,
Sent to his son,
�All is forgiven,
Fat calf for one.�
O that I ever
Thought he was stern,
Money for passage,
Write by return.
