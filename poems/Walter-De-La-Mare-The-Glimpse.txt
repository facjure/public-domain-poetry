 Art thou asleep? or have thy wings
 Wearied of my unchanging skies?
 Or, haply, is it fading dreams
 Are in my eyes?

 Not even an echo in my heart
 Tells me the courts thy feet trod last,
 Bare as a leafless wood it is,
 The summer past.

 My inmost mind is like a book
 The reader dulls with lassitude,
 Wherein the same old lovely words
 Sound poor and rude.

 Yet through this vapid surface, I
 Seem to see old-time deeps; I see,
 Past the dark painting of the hour,
 Life's ecstasy.

 Only a moment; as when day
 Is set, and in the shade of night,
 Through all the clouds that compassed her,
 Stoops into sight

 Pale, changeless, everlasting Dian,
 Gleams on the prone Endymion,
 Troubles the dulness of his dreams:
 And then is gone.
