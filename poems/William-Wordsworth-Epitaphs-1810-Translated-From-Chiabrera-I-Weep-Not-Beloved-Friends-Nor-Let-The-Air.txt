title: Epitaphs 1810. Translated From Chiabrera I. Weep Not, Beloved Friends! Nor Let The Air
---

 Weep not, beloved Friends! nor let the air
 For me with sighs be troubled. Not from life
 Have I been taken; this is genuine life
 And this alone, the life which now I live
 In peace eternal; where desire and joy
 Together move in fellowship without end.
 Francesco Ceni willed that, after death,
 His tombstone thus should speak for him. And surely
 Small cause there is for that fond wish of ours
 Long to continue in this world; a world
 That keeps not faith, nor yet can point a hope
 To good, whereof itself is destitute.
