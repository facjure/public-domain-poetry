 Argument Of The Seventeenth Book.


Sharp contest ensues around the body of Patroclus. Hector puts on the armor of Achilles. Menelaus, having dispatched Antilochus to Achilles with news of the death of Patroclus, returns to the battle, and, together with Meriones, bears Patroclus off the field, while the Ajaces cover their retreat.



 Nor Menelaus, Atreus' valiant son,
 Knew not how Menoetiades had fallen
 By Trojan hands in battle; forth he rush'd
 All bright in burnish'd armor through his van,
 And as some heifer with maternal fears
 Now first acquainted, compasses around
 Her young one murmuring, with tender moan,
 So moved the hero of the amber locks
 Around Patroclus, before whom his spear
 Advancing and broad shield, he death denounced
 On all opposers; neither stood the son
 Spear-famed of Panthus inattentive long
 To slain Patroclus, but approach'd the dead,
 And warlike Menelaus thus bespake.
 Prince! Menelaus! Atreus' mighty son!
 Yield. Leave the body and these gory spoils;
 For of the Trojans or allies of Troy
 None sooner made Patroclus bleed than I.
 Seek not to rob me, therefore, of my praise
 Among the Trojans, lest my spear assail
 Thee also, and thou perish premature.[1]
 To whom, indignant, Atreus' son replied.
 Self-praise, the Gods do know, is little worth.
 But neither lion may in pride compare
 Nor panther, nor the savage boar whose heart's
 High temper flashes in his eyes, with these
 The spear accomplish'd youths of Panthus' house.
 Yet Hyperenor of equestrian fame
 Lived not his lusty manhood to enjoy,
 Who scoffingly defied my force in arms,
 And call'd me most contemptible in fight
 Of all the Dana�. But him, I ween,
 His feet bore never hence to cheer at home
 His wife and parents with his glad return.
 So also shall thy courage fierce be tamed,
 If thou oppose me. I command thee, go--
 Mix with the multitude; withstand not me,
 Lest evil overtake thee! To be taught
 By sufferings only, is the part of fools.
 He said, but him sway'd not, who thus replied.
 Now, even now, Atrides! thou shalt rue
 My brother's blood which thou hast shed, and mak'st
 His death thy boast. Thou hast his blooming bride
 Widow'd, and thou hast fill'd his parents' hearts
 With anguish of unutterable wo;
 But bearing hence thy armor and thy head
 To Troy, and casting them at Panthus' feet,
 And at the feet of Phrontis, his espoused,
 I shall console the miserable pair.
 Nor will I leave that service unessay'd
 Longer, nor will I fail through want of force,
 Of courage, or of terrible address.
 He ceased, and smote his shield, nor pierced the disk,
 But bent his point against the stubborn brass.
 Then Menelaus, prayer preferring first
 To Jove,[2] assail'd Euphorbus in his turn,
 Whom pacing backward in the throat he struck,
 And both hands and his full force the spear
 Impelled, urged it through his neck behind.
 Sounding he fell; loud rang his batter'd arms.
 His locks, which even the Graces might have own'd,
 Blood-sullied, and his ringlets wound about
 With twine of gold and silver, swept the dust.
 As the luxuriant olive by a swain
 Rear'd in some solitude where rills abound,
 Puts forth her buds, and fann'd by genial airs
 On all sides, hangs her boughs with whitest flowers,
 But by a sudden whirlwind from its trench
 Uptorn, it lies extended on the field;
 Such, Panthus' warlike son Euphorbus seem'd,
 By Menelaus, son of Atreus, slain
 Suddenly, and of all his arms despoil'd.
 But as the lion on the mountains bred,
 Glorious in strength, when he hath seized the best
 And fairest of the herd, with savage fangs
 First breaks her neck, then laps the bloody paunch
 Torn wide; meantime, around him, but remote,
 Dogs stand and swains clamoring, yet by fear
 Repress'd, annoy him not nor dare approach;
 So there all wanted courage to oppose
 The force of Menelaus, glorious Chief.
 Then, easily had Menelaus borne
 The armor of the son of Panthus thence,
 But that Apollo the illustrious prize
 Denied him, who in semblance of the Chief
 Of the Ciconians, Mentes, prompted forth
 Against him Hector terrible as Mars,
 Whose spirit thus in accents wing'd he roused.
 Hector! the chase is vain; here thou pursuest
 The horses of �acides the brave,
 Which thou shalt never win, for they are steeds
 Of fiery nature, such as ill endure
 To draw or carry mortal man, himself
 Except, whom an immortal mother bore.
 Meantime, bold Menelaus, in defence
 Of dead Patroclus, hath a Trojan slain
 Of highest note, Euphorbus, Panthus' son,
 And hath his might in arms for ever quell'd.
 So spake the God and to the fight return'd.
 But grief intolerable at that word
 Seized Hector; darting through the ranks his eye,
 He knew at once who stripp'd Euphorbus' arms,
 And him knew also lying on the field,
 And from his wide wound bleeding copious still.
 Then dazzling bright in arms, through all the van
 He flew, shrill-shouting, fierce as Vulcan's fire
 Unquenchable; nor were his shouts unheard
 By Atreus' son, who with his noble mind
 Conferring sad, thus to himself began.
 Alas! if I forsake these gorgeous spoils,
 And leave Patroclus for my glory slain,
 I fear lest the Achaians at that sight
 Incensed, reproach me; and if, urged by shame,
 I fight with Hector and his host, alone,
 Lest, hemm'd around by multitudes, I fall;
 For Hector, by his whole embattled force
 Attended, comes. But whither tend my thoughts?
 No man may combat with another fenced
 By power divine and whom the Gods exalt,
 But he must draw down wo on his own head.
 Me, therefore, none of all Achaia's host
 Will blame indignant, seeing my retreat
 From Hector, whom themselves the Gods assist.
 But might the battle-shout of Ajax once
 Reach me, with force united we would strive,
 Even in opposition to a God,
 To rescue for Achilles' sake, his friend.
 Task arduous! but less arduous than this.
 While he thus meditated, swift advanced
 The Trojan ranks, with Hector at their head.
 He then, retiring slow, and turning oft,
 Forsook the body. As by dogs and swains
 With clamors loud and spears driven from the stalls
 A bearded lion goes, his noble heart
 Abhors retreat, and slow he quits the prey;
 So Menelaus with slow steps forsook
 Patroclus, and arrived in front, at length,
 Of his own phalanx, stood, with sharpen'd eyes
 Seeking vast Ajax, son of Telamon.
 Him leftward, soon, of all the field he mark'd
 Encouraging aloud his band, whose hearts
 With terrors irresistible himself
 Phoebus had fill'd. He ran, and at his side
 Standing, incontinent him thus bespake.
 My gallant Ajax, haste--come quickly--strive
 With me to rescue for Achilles' sake
 His friend, though bare, for Hector hath his arms.
 He said, and by his words the noble mind
 Of Ajax roused; issuing through the van
 He went, and Menelaus at his side.
 Hector the body of Patroclus dragg'd,
 Stript of his arms, with falchion keen erelong
 Purposing to strike off his head, and cast
 His trunk, drawn distant, to the dogs of Troy.
 But Ajax, with broad shield tower-like, approach'd.
 Then Hector, to his bands retreating, sprang
 Into his chariot, and to others gave
 The splendid arms in charge, who into Troy
 Should bear the destined trophy of his praise,
 But Ajax with his broad shield guarding stood
 Slain Menoetiades, as for his whelps
 The lion stands; him through some forest drear
 Leading his little ones, the hunters meet;
 Fire glimmers in his looks, and down he draws
 His whole brow into frowns, covering his eyes;
 So, guarding slain Patroclus, Ajax lour'd.
 On the other side, with tender grief oppress'd
 Unspeakable, brave Menelaus stood.
 But Glaucus, leader of the Lycian band,
 Son of Hippolochus, in bitter terms
 Indignant, reprimanded Hector thus,
 Ah, Hector, Chieftain of excelling form,
 But all unfurnish'd with a warrior's heart!
 Unwarranted I deem thy great renown
 Who art to flight addicted. Think, henceforth,
 How ye shall save city and citadel
 Thou and thy people born in Troy, alone.
 No Lycian shall, at least, in your defence
 Fight with the Grecians, for our ceaseless toil
 In arms, hath ever been a thankless task.
 Inglorious Chief! how wilt thou save a worse
 From warring crowds, who hast Sarpedon left
 Thy guest, thy friend, to be a spoil, a prey
 To yonder Argives? While he lived he much
 Thee and thy city profited, whom dead
 Thou fear'st to rescue even from the dogs.
 Now, therefore, may but my advice prevail,
 Back to your country, Lycians! so, at once,
 Shall remediless ruin fall on Troy.
 For had the Trojans now a daring heart
 Intrepid, such as in the breast resides
 Of laborers in their country's dear behalf,
 We soon should drag Patroclus into Troy;
 And were his body, from the battle drawn,
 In Priam's royal city once secured,
 As soon, the Argives would in ransom give
 Sarpedon's body with his splendid arms
 To be conducted safe into the town.
 For when Patroclus fell, the friend was slain
 Of such a Chief as is not in the fleet
 For valor, and his bands are dauntless all.
 But thou, at the first glimpse of Ajax' eye
 Confounded, hast not dared in arms to face
 That warrior bold, superior far to thee.
 To whom brave Hector, frowning stern, replied,
 Why, Glaucus! should a Chief like thee his tongue
 Presume to employ thus haughtily? My friend!
 I thee accounted wisest, once, of all
 Who dwell in fruitful Lycia, but thy speech
 Now utter'd altogether merits blame,
 In which thou tell'st me that I fear to stand
 Against vast Ajax. Know that I from fight
 Shrink not, nor yet from sound of prancing steeds;
 But Jove's high purpose evermore prevails
 Against the thoughts of man; he turns to flight
 The bravest, and the victory takes with ease
 Even from those whom once he favor'd most.
 But hither, friend! stand with me; mark my deed;
 Prove me, if I be found, as thou hast said,
 An idler all the day, or if by force
 I not compel some Grecian to renounce
 Patroclus, even the boldest of them all.
 He ceased, and to his host exclaim'd aloud.
 Trojans, and Lycians, and close-fighting sons
 Of Dardanus, oh be ye men, my friends!
 Now summon all your fortitude, while I
 Put on the armor of Achilles, won
 From the renown'd Patroclus slain by me.
 So saying, illustrious Hector from the clash
 Of spears withdrew, and with his swiftest pace
 Departing, overtook, not far remote,
 The bearers of Achilles' arms to Troy.
 Apart from all the horrors of the field
 Standing, he changed his armor; gave his own
 To be by them to sacred Ilium borne,
 And the immortal arms of Peleus' son
 Achilles, by the ever-living Gods
 To Pele�s given, put on. Those arms the Sire,
 Now old himself, had on his son conferr'd
 But in those arms his son grew never old.
 Him, therefore, soon as cloud-assembler Jove
 Saw glittering in divine Achilles' arms,
 Contemplative he shook his brows, and said,
 Ah hapless Chief! thy death, although at hand,
 Nought troubles thee. Thou wear'st his heavenly
 Who all excels, terror of Ilium's host.
 His friend, though bold yet gentle, thou hast slain
 And hast the brows and bosom of the dead
 Unseemly bared: yet, bright success awhile
 I give thee; so compensating thy lot,
 From whom Andromache shall ne'er receive
 Those glorious arms, for thou shalt ne'er return.
 So spake the Thunderer, and his sable brows
 Shaking, confirm'd the word. But Hector found
 The armor apt; the God of war his soul
 With fury fill'd, he felt his limbs afresh
 Invigorated, and with loudest shouts
 Return'd to his illustrious allies.
 To them he seem'd, clad in those radiant arms,
 Himself Achilles; rank by rank he pass'd
 Through all the host, exhorting every Chief,
 Asterop�us, Mesthles, Phorcys, Medon,
 Thersilochus, Deisenor, augur Ennomus,
 Chromius, Hippotho�s; all these he roused
 To battle, and in accents wing'd began.
 Hear me, ye myriads, neighbors and allies!
 For not through fond desire to fill the plain
 With multitudes, have I convened you here
 Each from his city, but that well-inclined
 To Ilium, ye might help to guard our wives
 And little ones against the host of Greece.
 Therefore it is that forage large and gifts
 Providing for you, I exhaust the stores
 Of Troy, and drain our people for your sake.
 Turn then direct against them, and his life
 Save each, or lose; it is the course of war.
 Him who shall drag, though dead, Patroclus home
 Into the host of Troy, and shall repulse
 Ajax, I will reward with half the spoils
 And half shall be my own; glory and praise
 Shall also be his meed, equal to mine.
 He ended; they compact with lifted spears
 Bore on the Dana�, conceiving each
 Warm expectation in his heart to wrest
 From Ajax son of Telamon, the dead.
 Vain hope! he many a lifeless Trojan heap'd
 On slain Patroclus, but at length his speech
 To warlike Menelaus thus address'd.
 Ah, Menelaus, valiant friend! I hope
 No longer, now, that even we shall 'scape
 Ourselves from fight; nor fear I so the loss
 Of dead Patroclus, who shall soon the dogs
 Of Ilium, and the fowls sate with his flesh,
 As for my life I tremble and for thine,
 That cloud of battle, Hector, such a gloom
 Sheds all around; death manifest impends.
 Haste--call our best, if even they can hear.
 He spake, nor Menelaus not complied,
 But call'd aloud on all the Chiefs of Greece.
 Friends, senators, and leaders of the powers
 Of Argos! who with Agamemnon drink
 And Menelaus at the public feast,
 Each bearing rule o'er many, by the will
 Of Jove advanced to honor and renown!
 The task were difficult to single out
 Chief after Chief by name amid the blaze
 Of such contention; but oh, come yourselves
 Indignant forth, nor let the dogs of Troy
 Patroclus rend, and gambol with his bones!
 He ceased, whom O�liades the swift
 Hearing incontinent, of all the Chiefs
 Ran foremost, after whom Idomeneus
 Approach'd, and dread as homicidal Mars
 Meriones. But never mind of man
 Could even in silent recollection name
 The whole vast multitude who, following these
 Renew'd the battle on the part of Greece.
 The Trojans first, with Hector at their head,
 Wedged in close phalanx, rush'd to the assault
 As when within some rapid river's mouth
 The billows and stream clash, on either shore[3]
 Loud sounds the roar[3] of waves ejected wide,
 Such seem'd the clamors of the Trojan host.
 But the Achaians, one in heart, around
 Patroclus stood, bulwark'd with shields of brass
 And over all their glittering helmets Jove
 Darkness diffused, for he had loved Patroclus
 While yet he lived friend of �acides,
 And now, abhorring that the dogs of Troy
 Should eat him, urged the Greeks to his defence,
 The host of Troy first shook the Grecian host;
 The body left, they fled; yet of them all,
 The Trojan powers, determined as they were,
 Slew none, but dragg'd the body. Neither stood
 The Greeks long time aloof, soon as repulsed
 Again led on by Ajax, who in form
 And in exploits all others far excell'd.
 Peerless �acides alone except.
 Right through the foremost combatants he rush'd,
 In force resembling most some savage boar
 That in the mountains bursting through the brakes,
 The swains disperses and their hounds with ease;
 Like him, illustrious Ajax, mighty son
 Of Telamon, at his assault dispersed
 With ease the close imbattled ranks who fought
 Around Patroclus' body, strong in hope
 To achieve it, and to make the glory theirs.
 Hippotho�s, a youth of high renown,
 Son of Pelasgian Lethus, by a noose
 Around his ancle cast dragg'd through the fight
 Patroclus, so to gratify the host
 Of Ilium and their Chief; but evil him
 Reached suddenly, by none of all his friends
 (Though numerous wish'd to save him) turn'd aside.
 For swift advancing on him through the crowd
 The son of Telamon pierced, spear in hand,
 His helmet brazen-cheek'd; the crested casque,
 So smitten, open'd wide, for huge the hand
 And ponderous was the spear that gave the blow
 And all around its neck, mingled with blood
 Gush'd forth the brain. There, lifeless, down he sank,
 Let fall the hero's foot, and fell himself
 Prone on the dead, never to see again?
 Deep-soil'd Larissa, never to require
 Their kind solicitudes who gave him birth,
 In bloom of life by dauntless Ajax slain.
 Then Hector hurl'd at Ajax his bright spear,
 But he, forewarn'd of its approach, escaped
 Narrowly, and it pierced Schedius instead,
 Brave son of Iphitus; he, noblest Chief
 Of the Phocensians, over many reign'd,
 Dwelling in Panopeus the far-renown'd.
 Entering beneath the clavicle[4] the point
 Right through his shoulder's summit pass'd behind,
 And on his loud-resounding arms he fell.
 But Ajax at his waist wounded the son
 Of Phoenops, valiant Phorcys, while he stood
 Guarding Hippoth�us; through his hollow mail
 Enforced the weapon drank his inmost life,
 And in his palm, supine, he clench'd the dust.
 Then, Hector with the foremost Chiefs of Troy
 Fell back; the Argives sent a shout to heaven,
 And dragging Phorcys and Hippoth�us thence
 Stripp'd both. In that bright moment Ilium's host
 Fear-quell'd before Achaia's warlike sons
 Had Troy re-enter'd, and the host of Greece
 By matchless might and fortitude their own
 Had snatch'd a victory from the grasp of fate,
 But that, himself, the King of radiant shafts
 �neas roused; Epytis' son he seem'd
 Periphas, ancient in the service grown
 Of old Anchises whom he dearly loved;
 His form assumed, Apollo thus began.
 How could ye save, �neas, were the Gods
 Your enemies, the towers of lofty Troy?
 As I have others seen, warriors who would,
 Men fill'd with might and valor, firm themselves
 And Chiefs of multitudes disdaining fear.
 But Jove to us the victory far more
 Than to the Grecians wills; therefore the fault
 Is yours, who tremble and refuse the fight.
 He ended, whom �neas marking, knew
 At once the glorious Archer of the skies,
 And thus to distant Hector call'd aloud.
 Oh, Hector, and ye other Chiefs of Troy
 And of her brave confederates! Shame it were
 Should we re-enter Ilium, driven to flight
 By dastard fear before the host of Greece.
 A God assured me even now, that Jove,
 Supreme in battle, gives his aid to Troy.
 Rush, therefore, on the Dana� direct,
 Nor let them, safe at least and unannoy'd,
 Bear hence Patroclus' body to the fleet.
 He spake, and starting far into the van
 Stood foremost forth; they, wheeling, faced the Greeks.
 Then, spear in hand, �neas smote the friend
 Of Lycomedes, brave Leocritus,
 Son of Arisbas. Lycomedes saw
 Compassionate his death, and drawing nigh
 First stood, then hurling his resplendent lance,
 Right through the liver Apisaon pierced
 Offspring of Hippasus, his chest beneath,
 And, lifeless, instant, on the field he fell.
 He from P�onia the deep soil'd to Troy
 Came forth, Asterop�us sole except,
 Bravest of all P�onia's band in arms.
 Asterop�us saw, and to the van
 Sprang forth for furious combat well prepared,
 But room for fight found none, so thick a fence
 Of shields and ported spears fronted secure
 The phalanx guarding Menoetiades.
 For Ajax ranging all the ranks, aloud
 Admonish'd them that no man yielding ground
 Should leave Patroclus, or advance before
 The rest, but all alike fight and stand fast.
 Such order gave huge Ajax; purple gore
 Drench'd all the ground; in slaughter'd heaps they fell
 Trojans and Trojan aids of dauntless hearts
 And Grecians; for not even they the fight
 Waged bloodless, though with far less cost of blood,
 Each mindful to avert his fellow's fate.
 Thus burn'd the battle; neither hadst thou deem'd
 The sun himself in heaven unquench'd, or moon,
 Beneath a cope so dense of darkness strove
 Unceasing all the most renown'd in arms
 For Menoetiades. Meantime the war,
 Wherever else, the bright-arm'd Grecians waged
 And Trojans under skies serene. The sun
 On them his radiance darted; not a cloud,
 From mountain or from vale rising, allay'd
 His fervor; there at distance due they fought
 And paused by turns, and shunn'd the cruel dart.
 But in the middle field not war alone
 They suffer'd, but night also; ruthless raged
 The iron storm, and all the mightiest bled.
 Two glorious Chiefs, the while, Antilochus
 And Thrasymedes, had no tidings heard
 Of brave Patroclus slain, but deem'd him still
 Living, and troubling still the host of Troy;
 For watchful[5] only to prevent the flight
 Or slaughter of their fellow-warriors, they
 Maintain'd a distant station, so enjoin'd
 By Nestor when he sent them to the field.
 But fiery conflict arduous employ'd
 The rest all day continual; knees and legs,
 Feet, hands, and eyes of those who fought to guard
 The valiant friend of swift �acides
 Sweat gather'd foul and dust. As when a man
 A huge ox-hide drunken with slippery lard
 Gives to be stretch'd, his servants all around
 Disposed, just intervals between, the task
 Ply strenuous, and while many straining hard
 Extend it equal on all sides, it sweats
 The moisture out, and drinks the unction in,[6]
 So they, in narrow space struggling, the dead
 Dragg'd every way, warm hope conceiving, these
 To drag him thence to Troy, those, to the ships.
 Wild tumult raged around him; neither Mars,
 Gatherer of hosts to battle, nor herself
 Pallas, however angry, had beheld
 That conflict with disdain, Jove to such length
 Protracted on that day the bloody toil
 Of steeds and men for Menoetiades.
 Nor knew divine Achilles or had aught
 Heard of Patroclus slain, for from the ships
 Remote they fought, beneath the walls of Troy.
 He, therefore, fear'd not for his death, but hope
 Indulged much rather, that, the battle push'd
 To Ilium's gates, he should return alive.
 For that his friend, unaided by himself
 Or ever aided, should prevail to lay
 Troy waste, he nought supposed; by Thetis warn'd
 In secret conference oft, he better knew
 Jove's purpose; yet not even she had borne
 Those dreadful tidings to his ear, the loss
 Immeasurable of his dearest friend.
 They all around the dead fought spear in hand
 With mutual slaughter ceaseless, and amid
 Achaia's host thus spake a Chief mail-arm'd.
 Shame were it, Grecians! should we seek by flight
 Our galleys now; yawn earth our feet beneath
 And here ingulf us rather! Better far
 Than to permit the steed-famed host of Troy
 To drag Patroclus hence into the town,
 And make the glory of this conflict theirs.
 Thus also of the dauntless Trojans spake
 A certain warrior. Oh, my friends! although
 The Fates ordain us, one and all, to die
 Around this body, stand! quit not the field.
 So spake the warrior prompting into act
 The courage of his friends, and such they strove
 On both sides; high into the vault of heaven
 The iron din pass'd through the desart air.
 Meantime the horses of �acides
 From fight withdrawn, soon as they understood
 Their charioteer fallen in the dust beneath
 The arm of homicidal Hector, wept.
 Them oft with hasty lash Diores' son
 Automedon impatient smote, full oft
 He stroked them gently, and as oft he chode;[7]
 Yet neither to the fleet ranged on the shore
 Of spacious Hellespont would they return,
 Nor with the Grecians seek the fight, but stood
 As a sepulchral pillar stands, unmoved
 Between their traces;[8] to the earth they hung
 Their heads, with plenteous tears their driver mourn'd,
 And mingled their dishevell'd manes with dust.
 Jove saw their grief with pity, and his brows
 Shaking, within himself thus, pensive, said.
 Ah hapless pair! Wherefore by gift divine
 Were ye to Peleus given, a mortal king,
 Yourselves immortal and from age exempt?
 Was it that ye might share in human woes?
 For, of all things that breathe or creep the earth,
 No creature lives so mere a wretch as man.
 Yet shall not Priameian Hector ride
 Triumphant, drawn by you. Myself forbid.
 Suffice it that he boasts vain-gloriously
 Those arms his own. Your spirit and your limbs
 I will invigorate, that ye may bear
 Safe hence Automedon into the fleet.
 For I ordain the Trojans still to spread
 Carnage around victorious, till they reach
 The gallant barks, and till the sun at length
 Descending, sacred darkness cover all.
 He said, and with new might the steeds inspired.
 They, shaking from their hair profuse the dust,
 Between the van of either army whirl'd
 The rapid chariot. Fighting as he pass'd,
 Though fill'd with sorrow for his slaughter'd friend,
 Automedon high-mounted swept the field
 Impetuous as a vulture scattering geese;
 Now would he vanish, and now, turn'd again,
 Chase through a multitude his trembling foe;
 But whomsoe'er he follow'd, none he slew,
 Nor was the task possible to a Chief
 Sole in the sacred chariot, both to aim
 The spear aright and guide the fiery steeds.
 At length Alcimedon, his friend in arms,
 Son of Laerceus son of �mon, him
 Observing, from behind the chariot hail'd
 The flying warrior, whom he thus bespake.
 What power, Automedon! hath ta'en away
 Thy better judgment, and thy breast inspired
 With this vain purpose to assail alone
 The Trojan van? Thy partner in the fight
 Is slain, and Hector on his shoulders bears,
 Elate, the armor of �acides.
 Then, answer thus Automedon return'd,
 Son of Diores. Who of all our host
 Was ever skill'd, Alcimedon! as thou
 To rule the fire of these immortal steeds,
 Save only while he lived, peer of the Gods
 In that great art, Patroclus, now no more?
 Thou, therefore, the resplendent reins receive
 And scourge, while I, dismounting, wage the fight.
 He ceased; Alcimedon without delay
 The battle-chariot mounting, seized at once
 The lash and reins, and from his seat down leap'd
 Automedon. Them noble Hector mark'd,
 And to �neas at his side began.
 Illustrious Chief of Trojans brazen-mail'd
 �neas! I have noticed yonder steeds
 Of swift Achilles rushing into fight
 Conspicuous, but under sway of hands
 Unskilful; whence arises a fair hope
 That we might seize them, wert thou so inclined;
 For never would those two dare to oppose
 In battle an assault dreadful as ours.
 He ended, nor the valiant son refused
 Of old Anchises, but with targets firm
 Of season'd hide brass-plated thrown athwart
 Their shoulders, both advanced direct, with whom
 Of godlike form Aretus also went
 And Chromius. Ardent hope they all conceived
 To slay those Chiefs, and from the field to drive
 Achilles' lofty steeds. Vain hope! for them
 No bloodless strife awaited with the force
 Of brave Automedon; he, prayer to Jove
 First offering, felt his angry soul with might
 Heroic fill'd, and thus his faithful friend
 Alcimedon, incontinent, address'd.
 Alcimedon! hold not the steeds remote
 But breathing on my back; for I expect
 That never Priame�an Hector's rage
 Shall limit know, or pause, till, slaying us,
 He shall himself the coursers ample-maned
 Mount of Achilles, and to flight compel
 The Argive host, or perish in the van.
 So saying, he call'd aloud on Menelaus
 With either Ajax. Oh, illustrious Chiefs
 Of Argos, Menelaus, and ye bold
 Ajaces![9] leaving all your best to cope
 With Ilium's powers and to protect the dead,
 From friends still living ward the bitter day.
 For hither borne, two Chiefs, bravest of all
 The Trojans, Hector and �neas rush
 Right through the battle. The events of war
 Heaven orders; therefore even I will give
 My spear its flight, and Jove dispose the rest!
 He said, and brandishing his massy spear
 Dismiss'd it at Aretus; full he smote
 His ample shield, nor stay'd the pointed brass,
 But penetrating sheer the disk, his belt
 Pierced also, and stood planted in his waist.
 As when some vigorous youth with sharpen'd axe
 A pastured bullock smites behind the horns
 And hews the muscle through; he, at the stroke
 Springs forth and falls, so sprang Aretus forth,
 Then fell supine, and in his bowels stood
 The keen-edged lance still quivering till he died.
 Then Hector, in return, his radiant spear
 Hurl'd at Automedon, who of its flight
 Forewarn'd his body bowing prone, the stroke
 Eluded, and the spear piercing the soil
 Behind him, shook to its superior end,
 Till, spent by slow degrees, its fury slept.
 And now, with hand to hilt, for closer war
 Both stood prepared, when through the multitude
 Advancing at their fellow-warrior's call,
 The Ajaces suddenly their combat fierce
 Prevented. Awed at once by their approach
 Hector retired, with whom �neas went
 Also and godlike Chromius, leaving there
 Aretus with his vitals torn, whose arms,
 Fierce as the God of war Automedon
 Stripp'd off, and thus exulted o'er the slain.
 My soul some portion of her grief resigns
 Consoled, although by slaughter of a worse,
 For loss of valiant Menoetiades.
 So saying, within his chariot he disposed
 The gory spoils, then mounted it himself
 With hands and feet purpled, as from a bull
 His bloody prey, some lion newly-gorged.
 And now around Patroclus raged again
 Dread strife deplorable! for from the skies
 Descending at the Thunderer's command
 Whose purpose now was to assist the Greeks,
 Pallas enhanced the fury of the fight.
 As when from heaven, in view of mortals, Jove
 Exhibits bright his bow, a sign ordain'd
 Of war, or numbing frost which all the works
 Suspends of man and saddens all the flocks;
 So she, all mantled with a radiant cloud
 Entering Achaia's host, fired every breast.
 But meeting Menelaus first, brave son
 Of Atreus, in the form and with the voice
 Robust of Phoenix, him she thus bespake.
 Shame, Menelaus, shall to thee redound
 For ever, and reproach, should dogs devour
 The faithful friend of Peleus' noble son
 Under Troy's battlements; but stand, thyself,
 Undaunted, and encourage all the host.
 To whom the son of Atreus bold in arms.
 Ah, Phoenix, friend revered, ancient and sage!
 Would Pallas give me might and from the dint
 Shield me of dart and spear, with willing mind
 I would defend Patroclus, for his death
 Hath touch'd me deep. But Hector with the rage
 Burns of consuming fire, nor to his spear
 Gives pause, for him Jove leads to victory.
 He ceased, whom Pallas, Goddess azure-eyed
 Hearing, rejoiced that of the heavenly powers
 He had invoked her foremost to his aid.
 His shoulders with new might, and limbs she fill'd,
 And persevering boldness to his breast
 Imparted, such as prompts the fly, which oft
 From flesh of man repulsed, her purpose yet
 To bite holds fast, resolved on human blood.
 His stormy bosom with such courage fill'd
 By Pallas, to Patroclus he approach'd
 And hurl'd, incontinent, his glittering spear.
 There was a Trojan Chief, Podes by name,
 Son of E�tion, valorous and rich;
 Of all Troy's citizens him Hector most
 Respected, in convivial pleasures sweet
 His chosen companion. As he sprang to flight,
 The hero of the golden locks his belt
 Struck with full force and sent the weapon through.
 Sounding he fell, and from the Trojan ranks
 Atrides dragg'd the body to his own.
 Then drew Apollo near to Hector's side,
 And in the form of Phoenops, Asius' son,
 Of all the foreign guests at Hector's board
 His favorite most, the hero thus address'd.
 What Chief of all the Grecians shall henceforth
 Fear Hector, who from Menelaus shrinks
 Once deem'd effeminate, but dragging now
 The body of thy valiant friend approved
 Whom he hath slain, Podes, E�tion's son?
 He spake, and at his words grief like a cloud
 Involved the mind of Hector dark around;
 Right through the foremost combatants he rush'd
 All clad in dazzling brass. Then, lifting high
 His tassel'd �gis radiant, Jove with storms
 Enveloped Ida; flash'd his lightnings, roar'd
 His thunders, and the mountain shook throughout.
 Troy's host he prosper'd, and the Greeks dispersed.
 First fled Peneleus, the Boeotian Chief,
 Whom facing firm the foe Polydamas
 Struck on his shoulder's summit with a lance
 Hurl'd nigh at hand, which slight inscribed the bone.
 [10]Le�tus also, son of the renown'd
 Alectryon, pierced by Hector in the wrist,
 Disabled left the fight; trembling he fled
 And peering narrowly around, nor hoped
 To lift a spear against the Trojans more.
 Hector, pursuing Le�tus, the point
 Encounter'd of the brave Idomeneus
 Full on his chest; but in his mail the lance
 Snapp'd, and the Trojans shouted to the skies.
 He, in his turn, cast at Deucalion's son
 Idomeneus, who in that moment gain'd[11]
 A chariot-seat; but him the erring spear
 Attain'd not, piercing Coeranus instead
 The friend and follower of Meriones
 From wealthy Lyctus, and his charioteer.
 For when he left, that day, the gallant barks
 Idomeneus had sought the field on foot,
 And triumph proud, full sure, to Ilium's host
 Had yielded now, but that with rapid haste
 Coeranus drove to his relief, from him
 The fate averting which himself incurr'd
 Victim of Hector's homicidal arm.
 Him Hector smiting between ear and jaw
 Push'd from their sockets with the lance's point
 His firm-set teeth, and sever'd sheer his tongue.
 Dismounted down he fell, and from his hand
 Let slide the flowing reins, which, to the earth
 Stooping, Meriones in haste resumed,
 And briefly thus Idomeneus address'd.
 Now drive, and cease not, to the fleet of Greece!
 Thyself see'st victory no longer ours.
 He said; Idomeneus whom, now, dismay
 Seized also, with his lash plying severe
 The coursers ample-maned, flew to the fleet.
 Nor Ajax, dauntless hero, not perceived,
 Nor Menelaus, by the sway of Jove
 The victory inclining fast to Troy,
 And thus the Telamonian Chief began.
 Ah! who can be so blind as not to see
 The eternal Father, now, with his own hand
 Awarding glory to the Trojan host,
 Whose every spear flies, instant, to the mark
 Sent forth by brave or base? Jove guides them all,
 While, ineffectual, ours fall to the ground.
 But haste, devise we of ourselves the means
 How likeliest we may bear Patroclus hence,
 And gladden, safe returning, all our friends,
 Who, hither looking anxious, hope have none
 That we shall longer check the unconquer'd force
 Of hero-slaughtering Hector, but expect
 [12]To see him soon amid the fleet of Greece.
 Oh for some Grecian now to carry swift
 The tidings to Achilles' ear, untaught,
 As I conjecture, yet the doleful news
 Of his Patroclus slain! but no such Greek
 May I discern, such universal gloom
 Both men and steeds envelops all around.
 Father of heaven and earth! deliver thou
 Achaia's host from darkness; clear the skies;
 Give day; and (since thy sovereign will is such)
 Destruction with it--but oh give us day![13]
 He spake, whose tears Jove saw with pity moved,
 And chased the untimely shades; bright beam'd the sun
 And the whole battle was display'd. Then spake
 The hero thus to Atreus' mighty son.
 Now noble Menelaus! looking forth,
 See if Antilochus be yet alive,
 Brave son of Nestor, whom exhort to fly
 With tidings to Achilles, of the friend
 Whom most he loved, of his Patroclus slain.
 He ceased, nor Menelaus, dauntless Chief,
 That task refused, but went; yet neither swift
 Nor willing. As a lion leaves the stalls
 Wearied himself with harassing the guard,
 Who, interdicting him his purposed prey,
 Watch all the night; he famish'd, yet again
 Comes furious on, but speeds not, kept aloof
 By spears from daring hands dismissed, but more
 By flash of torches which, though fierce, he dreads,
 Till at the dawn, sullen he stalks away;
 So from Patroclus Menelaus went
 Heroic Chief! reluctant; for he fear'd
 Lest the Achaians should resign the dead,
 Through consternation, to the host of Troy.
 Departing, therefore, he admonish'd oft
 Meriones and the Ajaces, thus.
 Ye two brave leaders of the Argive host,
 And thou, Meriones! now recollect
 The gentle manners of Patroclus fallen
 Hapless in battle, who by carriage mild
 Well understood, while yet he lived, to engage
 All hearts, through prisoner now of death and fate.
 So saying, the hero amber-hair'd his steps
 Turn'd thence, the field exploring with an eye
 Sharp as the eagle's, of all fowls beneath
 The azure heavens for keenest sight renown'd,
 Whom, though he soar sublime, the leveret
 By broadest leaves conceal'd 'scapes not, but swift
 Descending, even her he makes his prey;
 So, noble Menelaus! were thine eyes
 Turn'd into every quarter of the host
 In search of Nestor's son, if still he lived.
 Him, soon, encouraging his band to fight,
 He noticed on the left of all the field,
 And sudden standing at his side, began.
 Antilochus! oh hear me, noble friend!
 And thou shalt learn tidings of such a deed
 As best had never been. Thou know'st, I judge,
 And hast already seen, how Jove exalts
 To victory the Trojan host, and rolls
 Distress on ours; but ah! Patroclus lies,
 Our chief Achaian, slain, whose loss the Greeks
 Fills with regret. Haste, therefore, to the fleet,
 Inform Achilles; bid him haste to save,
 If save he can, the body of his friend;
 He can no more, for Hector hath his arms.
 He ceased. Antilochus with horror heard
 Those tidings; mute long time he stood, his eyes
 Swam tearful, and his voice, sonorous erst,
 Found utterance none. Yet even so distress'd,
 He not the more neglected the command
 Of Menelaus. Setting forth to run,
 He gave his armor to his noble friend
 Laodocus, who thither turn'd his steeds,
 And weeping as he went, on rapid feet
 Sped to Achilles with that tale of wo.
 Nor could the noble Menelaus stay
 To give the weary Pylian band, bereft
 Of their beloved Antilochus, his aid,
 But leaving them to Thrasymedes' care,
 He flew to Menoetiades again,
 And the Ajaces, thus, instant bespake.
 He goes. I have dispatch'd him to the fleet
 To seek Achilles; but his coming naught
 Expect I now, although with rage he burn
 Against illustrious Hector; for what fight
 Can he, unarm'd, against the Trojans wage?
 Deliberating, therefore, frame we means
 How best to save Patroclus, and to 'scape
 Ourselves unslain from this disastrous field.
 Whom answer'd the vast son of Telamon.
 Most noble Menelaus! good is all
 Which thou hast spoken. Lift ye from the earth
 Thou and Meriones, at once, and bear
 The dead Patroclus from the bloody field.
 To cope meantime with Hector and his host
 Shall be our task, who, one in name, nor less
 In spirit one, already have the brunt
 Of much sharp conflict, side by side, sustain'd.
 He ended; they enfolding in their arms
 The dead, upbore him high above the ground
 With force united; after whom the host
 Of Troy, seeing the body borne away,
 Shouted, and with impetuous onset all
 Follow'd them. As the hounds, urged from behind
 By youthful hunters, on the wounded boar
 Make fierce assault; awhile at utmost speed
 They stretch toward him hungering, for the prey,
 But oft as, turning sudden, the stout brawn
 Faces them, scatter'd on all sides escape;
 The Trojans so, thick thronging in the rear,
 Ceaseless with falchions and spears double-edged
 Annoy'd them sore, but oft as in retreat
 The dauntless heroes, the Ajaces turn'd
 To face them, deadly wan grew every cheek,
 And not a Trojan dared with onset rude
 Molest them more in conflict for the dead.
 Thus they, laborious, forth from battle bore
 Patroclus to the fleet, tempestuous war
 Their steps attending, rapid as the flames
 Which, kindled suddenly, some city waste;
 Consumed amid the blaze house after house
 Sinks, and the wind, meantime, roars through the fire;
 So them a deafening tumult as they went
 Pursued, of horses and of men spear-arm'd.
 And as two mules with strength for toil endued,
 Draw through rough ways down from the distant hills
 Huge timber, beam or mast; sweating they go,
 And overlabor'd to faint weariness;
 So they the body bore, while, turning oft,
 The Ajaces check'd the Trojans. As a mound
 Planted with trees and stretch'd athwart the mead
 Repels an overflow; the torrents loud
 Baffling, it sends them far away to float
 The level land, nor can they with the force
 Of all their waters burst a passage through;
 So the Ajaces, constant, in the rear
 Repress'd the Trojans; but the Trojans them
 Attended still, of whom �neas most
 Troubled them, and the glorious Chief of Troy.
 They as a cloud of starlings or of daws
 Fly screaming shrill, warn'd timely of the kite
 Or hawk, devourers of the smaller kinds,
 So they shrill-clamoring toward the fleet,
 Hasted before �neas and the might
 Of Hector, nor the battle heeded more.
 Much radiant armor round about the foss
 Fell of the flying Grecians, or within
 Lay scatter'd, and no pause of war they found.
