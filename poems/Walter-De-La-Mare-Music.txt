 When music sounds, gone is the earth I know,
 And all her lovely things even lovelier grow;
 Her flowers in vision flame, her forest trees
 Lift burdened branches, stilled with ecstasies.

 When music sounds, out of the water rise
 Naiads whose beauty dims my waking eyes,
 Rapt in strange dreams burns each enchanted face,
 With solemn echoing stirs their dwelling-place.

 When music sounds, all that I was I am
 Ere to this haunt of brooding dust I came;
 While from Time's woods break into distant song
 The swift-winged hours, as I haste along.
