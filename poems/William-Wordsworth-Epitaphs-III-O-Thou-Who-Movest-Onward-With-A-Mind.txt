title: Epitaphs III. O Thou Who Movest Onward With A Mind
---

 O thou who movest onward with a mind
 Intent upon thy way, pause, though in haste!
 'Twill be no fruitless moment. I was born
 Within Savona's walls, of gentle blood.
 On Tiber's banks my youth was dedicate
 To sacred studies; and the Roman Shepherd
 Gave to my charge Urbino's numerous flock.
 Well did I watch, much laboured, nor had power
 To escape from many and strange indignities;
 Was smitten by the great ones of the world,
 But did not fall; for Virtue braves all shocks,
 Upon herself resting immoveably.
 Me did a kindlier fortune then invite
 To serve the glorious Henry, King of France,
 And in his hands I saw a high reward
 Stretched out for my acceptance, but Death came.
 Now, Reader, learn from this my fate, how false,
 How treacherous to her promise, is the world;
 And trust in God, to whose eternal doom
 Must bend the sceptred Potentates of earth.
