I.

The City Child.


Dainty little maiden, whither would you wander?
Whither from this pretty home, the home where mother dwells?
�Far and far away,� said the dainty little maiden,
�All among the gardens, auriculas, anemones,
Roses and lilies and Canterbury-bells.�

Dainty little maiden, whither would you wander?
Whither from this pretty house, this city-house of ours?
�Far and far away,� said the dainty little maiden,
�All among the meadows, the clover and the clematis,
Daisies and kingcups and honeysuckle-flowers.�

II.

Minnie and Winnie.


Minnie and Winnie
Slept in a shell.
Sleep, little ladies!
And they slept well.

Pink was the shell within,
Silver without;
Sounds of the great sea
Wander�d about.

Sleep, little ladies!
Wake not soon!
Echo on echo
Dies to the moon.

Two bright stars
Peep�d into the shell.
�What are they dreaming of?
Who can tell?�

Started a green linnet
Out of the croft;
Wake, little ladies,
The sun is aloft!
