Though beauty be the mark of praise,
And yours of whom I sing be such
As not the world can praise too much,
Yet �tis your Virtue now I raise.

A virtue, like allay so gone
Throughout your form as, though that move
And draw and conquer all men�s love,
This subjects you to love of one.

Wherein you triumph yet because
�Tis of your flesh, and that you use
The noblest freedom, not to choose
Against or faith or honour�s laws.

But who should less expect from you?
In whom alone Love lives again:
By whom he is restored to men,
And kept and bred and brought up true.

His falling temples you have rear�d,
The wither�d garlands ta�en away;
His altars kept from that decay
That envy wish�d, and nature fear�d:

And on them burn so chaste a flame,
With so much loyalty�s expense,
As Love to acquit such excellence
Is gone himself into your name.

And you are he the deity
To whom all lovers are design�d
That would their better objects find;
Among which faithful troop am I.

Who as an off�ring at your shrine
Have sung this hymn, and here entreat
One spark of your diviner heat
To light upon a love of mine.

Which if it kindle not, but scant
Appear, and that to shortest view;
Yet give me leave to adore in you
What I in her am grieved to want!
