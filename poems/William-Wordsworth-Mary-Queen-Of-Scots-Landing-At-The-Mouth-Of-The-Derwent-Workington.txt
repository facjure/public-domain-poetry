title: Mary Queen Of Scots - Landing At The Mouth Of The Derwent, Workington
---

 Dear to the Loves, and to the Graces vowed,
 The Queen drew back the wimple that she wore;
 And to the throng, that on the Cumbrian shore
 Her landing hailed, how touchingly she bowed!
 And like a Star (that, from a heavy cloud
 Of pine-tree foliage poised in air, forth darts,
 When a soft summer gale at evening parts
 The gloom that did its loveliness enshroud)
 She smiled; but Time, the old Saturnian seer,
 Sighed on the wing as her foot pressed the strand,
 With step prelusive to a long array
 Of woes and degradations hand in hand
 Weeping captivity, and shuddering fear
 Stilled by the ensanguined block of Fotheringay!
