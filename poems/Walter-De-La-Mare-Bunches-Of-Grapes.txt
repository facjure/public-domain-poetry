 'Bunches of grapes,' says Timothy;
 'Pomegranates pink,' says Elaine;
 'A junket of cream and a cranberry tart
For me,' says Jane.

 'Love-in-a-mist,' says Timothy;
 'Primroses pale,' says Elaine;
 'A nosegay of pinks and mignonette
For me,' says Jane.

 'Chariots of gold,' says Timothy;
 'Silvery wings,' says Elaine;
 'A bumpity ride in a wagon of hay
For me,' says Jane.
