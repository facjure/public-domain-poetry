title: Begging Another
---

For love�s sake, kiss me once again;
I long, and should not beg in vain,
Here�s none to spy or see;
Why do you doubt or stay?
I�ll taste as lightly as the bee
That doth but touch his flower and flies away.

Once more, and faith I will be gone;
Can he that loves ask less than one?
Nay, you may err in this
And all your bounty wrong;
This could be called but half a kiss,
What we�re but once to do, we should do long.

I will but mend the last, and tell
Where, how it should have relished well;
Join lip to lip, and try
Each suck other�s breath.
And whilst our tongues perplexed lie,
Let who will, think us dead or wish our death.
