 I had a silver buckle,
 I sewed it on my shoe,
 And 'neath a sprig of mistletoe
 I danced the evening through!

 I had a bunch of cowslips,
 I hid 'em in a grot,
 In case the elves should come by night
 And me remember not.

 I had a yellow riband,
 I tied it in my hair,
 That, walking in the garden,
 The birds might see it there.

 I had a secret laughter,
 I laughed it near the wall:
 Only the ivy and the wind
 May tell of it at all.
