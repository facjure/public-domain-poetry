 How fast the Marian death-list is unrolled!
 See Latimer and Ridley in the might
 Of Faith stand coupled for a common flight!
 One (like those prophets whom God sent of old)
 Transfigured, from this kindling hath foretold
 A torch of inextinguishable light;
 The Other gains a confidence as bold;
 And thus they foil their enemy's despite.
 The penal instruments, the shows of crime,
 Are glorified while this once-mitred pair
 Of saintly Friends the "murtherer's chain partake,
 Corded, and burning at the social stake:"
 Earth never witnessed object more sublime
 In constancy, in fellowship more fair!
