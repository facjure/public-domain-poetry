 Bury him without a word!
No appeal to death;
 Only the call of the bird
And the blind spring's breath.

 Nature slays ten, yet the one
Reaches but to a part
 Of what's to be done, to be sung.
Keep we a proud heart!

 Let us not glose her waste
With lies and dreams;
 Fawn on her wanton haste,
Say it but seems.

 Comrades, with faces unstirred,
Scorning grief's dole,
 Though with him, with him lies interred
Our heart and soul,

 Bury him without a word!
No appeal to death;
 Only the call of the bird
And the blind spring's breath.
