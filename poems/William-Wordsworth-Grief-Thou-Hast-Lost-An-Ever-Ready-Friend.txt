title: Grief, Thou Hast Lost An Ever-Ready Friend
---

 Grief, thou hast lost an ever-ready friend
 Now that the cottage Spinning-wheel is mute;
 And Care, a comforter that best could suit
 Her froward mood, and softliest reprehend;
 And Love, a charmer's voice, that used to lend,
 More efficaciously than aught that flows
 From harp or lute, kind influence to compose
 The throbbing pulse, else troubled without end:
 Even Joy could tell, Joy craving truce and rest
 From her own overflow, what power sedate
 On those revolving motions did await
 Assiduously to soothe her aching breast;
 And, to a point of just relief, abate
 The mantling triumphs of a day too blest.
