 Dread hour! when, upheaved by war's sulphurous blast,
 This sweet-visaged Cherub of Parian stone
 So far from the holy enclosure was cast,
 To couch in this thicket of brambles alone,

 To rest where the lizard may bask in the palm
 Of his half-open hand pure from blemish or speck;
 And the green, gilded snake, without troubling the calm
 Of the beautiful countenance, twine round his neck;

 Where haply (kind service to Piety due!)
 When winter the grove of its mantle bereaves,
 Some bird (like our own honoured redbreast) may strew
 The desolate Slumberer with moss and with leaves.

 Fuentes once harboured the good and the brave,
 Nor to her was the dance of soft pleasure unknown;
 Her banners for festal enjoyment did wave
 While the thrill of her fifes thro' the mountains was blown:

 Now gads the wild vine o'er the pathless ascent;
 O silence of Nature, how deep is thy sway,
 When the whirlwind of human destruction is spent,
 Our tumults appeased, and our strifes passed away!
