 O Mountain Stream! the Shepherd and his Cot
 Are privileged Inmates of deep solitude;
 Nor would the nicest Anchorite exclude
 A field or two of brighter green, or plot
 Of tillage-ground, that seemeth like a spot
 Of stationary sunshine: thou hast viewed
 These only, Duddon! with their paths renewed
 By fits and starts, yet this contents thee not.
 Thee hath some awful Spirit impelled to leave,
 Utterly to desert, the haunts of men,
 Though simple thy companions were and few;
 And through this wilderness a passage cleave
 Attended but by thy own voice, save when
 The clouds and fowls of the air thy way pursue!
