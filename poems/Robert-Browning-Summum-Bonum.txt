title: Summum Bonum

All the breath and the bloom of the year in the bag of one bee:
All the wonder and wealth of the mine in the heart of one gem:
In the core of one pearl all the shade and the shine of the sea:

Breath and bloom, shade and shine, wonder, wealth, and, how far above them,
Truth, that�s brighter than gem,
Trust, that�s purer than pearl,
Brightest truth, purest trust in the universe, all were for me
In the kiss of one girl.
