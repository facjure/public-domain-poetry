 I am that Adam who, with Snake for guest,
 Hid anguished eyes upon Eve's piteous breast.
 I am that Adam who, with broken wings,
 Fled from the Seraph's brazen trumpetings.
 Betrayed and fugitive, I still must roam
 A world where sin, and beauty, whisper of Home.

 Oh, from wide circuit, shall at length I see
 Pure daybreak lighten again on Eden's tree?
 Loosed from remorse and hope and love's distress,
 Enrobe me again in my lost nakedness?
 No more with wordless grief a loved one grieve,
 But to Heaven's nothingness re-welcome Eve?
