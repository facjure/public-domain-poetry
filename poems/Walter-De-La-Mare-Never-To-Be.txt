title: Never-To-Be

 Down by the waters of the sea,
 Reigns the King of Never-to-be.
 His palace walls are black with night;
 His torches star and moon�s light,
 And for his timepiece deep and grave
 Beats on the green unhastening wave.

 Windswept are his high corridors;
 His pleasance the sea-mantled shores;
 For sentinel a shadow stands
 With hair in heaven, and cloudy hands;
 And round his bed, king's guards to be,
 Watch pines in iron solemnity.

 His hound is mute; his steed at will
 Roams pastures deep with asphodel;
 His queen is to her slumber gone;
 His courtiers mute lie, hewn in stone;
 He hath forgot where he did hide
 His sceptre in the mountain-side.

 Grey-capped and muttering, mad is he - 
 The childless King of Never-to-be;
 For all his people in the deep
 Keep everlasting fast asleep;
 And all his realm is foam and rain,
 Whispering of what comes not again.
