 AN OLD STORY.


I.
It was roses, roses, all the way,
With myrtle mixed in my path like mad:
The house-roofs seemed to heave and sway,
The church-spires flamed, such flags they had,
A year ago on this very day.

II.
The air broke into a mist with bells,
The old walls rocked with the crowd and cries.
Had I said, �Good folk, mere noise repels
But give me your sun from yonder skies!�
They had answered, �And afterward, what else?�

III.
Alack, it was I who leaped at the sun
To give it my loving friends to keep.
Nought man could do, have I left undone:
And you see my harvest, what I reap
This very day, now a year is run.

IV.
There�s nobody on the house-tops now
Just a palsied few at the windows set
For the best of the sight is, all allow,
At the Shambles� Gate, or, better yet,
By the very scaffold�s foot, I trow.

V.
I go in the rain, and, more than needs,
A rope cuts both my wrists behind;
And I think, by the feel, my forehead bleeds,
For they fling, whoever has a mind,
Stones at me for my year�s misdeeds.

VI.
Thus I entered Brescia, and thus I go!
In such triumphs, people have dropped down dead.
�Paid by the World, what dost thou owe
Me?� God might question: but now instead,
�Tis God shall requite! I am safer so.
