 When thy great soul was freed from mortal chains,
 Darling of England! many a bitter shower
 Fell on thy tomb; but emulative power
 Flowed in thy line through undegenerate veins.
 The Race of Alfred covet glorious pains
 When dangers threaten, dangers ever new!
 Black tempests bursting, blacker still in view!
 But manly sovereignty its hold retains;
 The root sincere, the branches bold to strive
 With the fierce tempest, while, within the round
 Of their protection, gentle virtues thrive;
 As oft, 'mid some green plot of open ground,
 Wide as the oak extends its dewy gloom,
 The fostered hyacinths spread their purple bloom.
