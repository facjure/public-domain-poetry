 Rapt above earth by power of one fair face,
 Hers in whose sway alone my heart delights,
 I mingle with the blest on those pure heights
 Where Man, yet mortal, rarely finds a place.
 With Him who made the Work that Work accords
 So well, that by its help and through his grace
 I raise my thoughts, inform my deeds and words,
 Clasping her beauty in my soul's embrace.
 Thus, if from two fair eyes mine cannot turn,
 I feel how in their presence doth abide
 Light which to God is both the way and guide;
 And, kindling at their lustre, if I burn,
 My noble fire emits the joyful ray
 That through the realms of glory shines for aye.
