 If it were only still!--
 With far away the shrill
 Crying of a cock;
 Or the shaken bell
 From a cow's throat
 Moving through the bushes;
 Or the soft shock
 Of wizened apples falling
 From an old tree
 In a forgotten orchard
 Upon the hilly rock!

 Oh, grey hill,
 Where the grazing herd
 Licks the purple blossom,
 Crops the spiky weed!
 Oh, stony pasture,
 Where the tall mullein
 Stands up so sturdy
 On its little seed!
