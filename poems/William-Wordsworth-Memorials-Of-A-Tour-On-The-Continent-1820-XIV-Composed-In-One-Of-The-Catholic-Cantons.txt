 Doomed as we are our native dust
 To wet with many a bitter shower,
 It ill befits us to disdain
 The altar, to deride the fane,
 Where simple Sufferers bend, in trust
 To win a happier hour.

 I love, where spreads the village lawn,
 Upon some knee-worn cell to gaze:
 Hail to the firm unmoving cross,
 Aloft, where pines their branches toss!
 And to the chapel far withdrawn,
 That lurks by lonely ways!

 Where'er we roam, along the brink
 Of Rhine, or by the sweeping Po,
 Through Alpine vale, or champain wide,
 Whate'er we look on, at our side
 Be Charity! to bid us think,
 And feel, if we would know.
