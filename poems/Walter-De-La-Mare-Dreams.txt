 Be gentle, O hands of a child;
 Be true: like a shadowy sea
 In the starry darkness of night
Are your eyes to me.

 But words are shallow, and soon
 Dreams fade that the heart once knew;
 And youth fades out in the mind,
In the dark eyes too.

 What can a tired heart say,
 Which the wise of the world have made dumb?
 Save to the lonely dreams of a child,
'Return again, come!'
