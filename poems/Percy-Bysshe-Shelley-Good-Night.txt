1.
Good-night? ah! no; the hour is ill
Which severs those it should unite;
Let us remain together still,
Then it will be GOOD night.

2.
How can I call the lone night good,
Though thy sweet wishes wing its flight?
Be it not said, thought, understood -
Then it will be - GOOD night.

3.
To hearts which near each other move
From evening close to morning light,
The night is good; because, my love,
They never SAY good-night.
