title: Composed In The Glen Of Loch Etive

 "This Land of Rainbows spanning glens whose walls,
 Rock-built, are hung with rainbow-coloured mists
 Of far-stretched Meres whose salt flood never rests
 Of tuneful Caves and playful Waterfalls
 Of Mountains varying momently their crests
 Proud be this Land! whose poorest huts are halls
 Where Fancy entertains becoming guests;
 While native song the heroic Past recalls."
 Thus, in the net of her own wishes caught,
 The Muse exclaimed; but Story now must hide
 Her trophies, Fancy crouch; the course of pride
 Has been diverted, other lessons taught,
 That make the Patriot-spirit bow her head
 Where the all-conquering Roman feared to tread.
