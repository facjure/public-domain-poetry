title: Written With A Slate Pencil On A Stone, On The Side Of The Mountain Of Black Comb

 Stay, bold Adventurer; rest awhile thy limbs
 On this commodious Seat! for much remains
 Of hard ascent before thou reach the top
 Of this huge Eminence, from blackness named,
 And, to far-travelled storms of sea and land,
 A favourite spot of tournament and war!
 But thee may no such boisterous visitants
 Molest; may gentle breezes fan thy brow;
 And neither cloud conceal, nor misty air
 Bedim, the grand terraqueous spectacle,
 From centre to circumference, unveiled!
 Know, if thou grudge not to prolong thy rest,
 That on the summit whither thou art bound,
 A geographic Labourer pitched his tent,
 With books supplied and instruments of art,
 To measure height and distance; lonely task,
 Week after week pursued! To him was given
 Full many a glimpse (but sparingly bestowed
 On timid man) of Nature's processes
 Upon the exalted hills. He made report
 That once, while there he plied his studious work
 Within that canvas Dwelling, colours, lines,
 And the whole surface of the out-spread map,
 Became invisible: for all around
 Had darkness fallen, unthreatened, unproclaimed
 As if the golden day itself had been
 Extinguished in a moment; total gloom,
 In which he sate alone, with unclosed eyes,
 Upon the blinded mountain's silent top!
