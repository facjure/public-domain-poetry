 Never more, Sailor,
 Shalt thou be
 Tossed on the wind-ridden,
 Restless sea.
 Its tides may labour;
 All the world
 Shake 'neath that weight
 Of waters hurled:
 But its whole shock
 Can only stir
 Thy dust to a quiet
 Even quieter.
 Thou mock'd'st at land
 Who now art come
 To such a small
 And shallow home;
 Yet bore the sea
 Full many a care
 For bones that once
 A sailor's were.
 And though the grave's
 Deep soundlessness
 Thy once sea-deafened
 Ear distress,
 No robin ever
 On the deep
 Hopped with his song
 To haunt thy sleep.
