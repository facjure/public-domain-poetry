A woman with a heart of gold
 I heard her called before I knew
 How noble was that heart and true,
How full of tenderness untold.

Her sympathies both broad and sure,
 Her one desire to do the right - 
 Clear visioned from the inner light
God gives to souls unworldly, pure.

A heart of gold that loves and gives,
 God's almoner from day to day,
 Of her there is but this to say:
The world is better that she lives.
