Fickle Summer's fled away,
 Shall we see her face again?
 Hearken to the weeping rain,
Never sunbeam greets the day.

More inconstant than the May,
 She cares nothing for our pain,
 Nor will hear the birds complain
In their bowers that once were gay.

Summer, Summer, come once more,
 Drive the shadows from the field,
All thy radiance round thee fling,
Be our lady as of yore;
 Then the earth her fruits shall yield,
Then the morning stars shall sing.
