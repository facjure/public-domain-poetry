 'Tis bitter-sweet, when winter nights are long,
 To watch, beside the flames which smoke and twist,
 The distant memories which slowly throng,
 Brought by the chime soft-singing through the mist.

 Happy the sturdy, vigorous-throated bell
 Who, spite of age alert and confident,
 Cries hourly, like some strong old sentinel
 Flinging the ready challenge from his tent.

 For me, my soul is cracked; when sick with care,
 She strives with songs to people the cold air
 It happens often that her feeble cries

 Mock the harsh rattle of a man who lies
 Wounded, forgotten, 'neath a mound of slain
 And dies, pinned fast, writhing his limbs in pain.
