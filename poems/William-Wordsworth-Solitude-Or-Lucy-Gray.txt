title: Solitude, Or Lucy Gray
---

 Oft I had heard of Lucy Gray:
 And, when I crossed the wild,
 I chanced to see at break of day
 The solitary child.

 No mate, no comrade Lucy knew;
 She dwelt on a wide moor,
 The sweetest thing that ever grew
 Beside a human door!

 You yet may spy the fawn at play,
 The hare upon the green;
 But the sweet face of Lucy Gray
 Will never more be seen.

 "To-night will be a stormy night
 You to the town must go;
 And take a lantern, Child, to light
 Your mother through the snow."

 "That, Father! will I gladly do:
 'Tis scarcely afternoon
 The minster-clock has just struck two,
 And yonder is the moon!"

 At this the Father raised his hook,
 And snapped a faggot-band;
 He plied his work; and Lucy took
 The lantern in her hand.

 Not blither is the mountain roe:
 With many a wanton stroke
 Her feet disperse the powdery snow,
 That rises up like smoke.

 The storm came on before its time:
 She wandered up and down;
 And many a hill did Lucy climb:
 But never reached the town.

 The wretched parents all that night
 Went shouting far and wide;
 But there was neither sound nor sight
 To serve them for a guide.

 At day-break on a hill they stood
 That overlooked the moor;
 And thence they saw the bridge of wood,
 A furlong from their door.

 They wept and, turning homeward, cried,
 "In heaven we all shall meet;"
 When in the snow the mother spied
 The print of Lucy's feet.

 Then downwards from the steep hill's edge
 They tracked the footmarks small;
 And through the broken hawthorn hedge,
 And by the long stone-wall;

 And then an open field they crossed:
 The marks were still the same;
 They tracked them on, nor ever lost;
 And to the bridge they came.

 They followed from the snowy bank
 Those footmarks, one by one,
 Into the middle of the plank;
 And further there were none!

 Yet some maintain that to this day
 She is a living child;
 That you may see sweet Lucy Gray
 Upon the lonesome wild.

 O'er rough and smooth she trips along,
 And never looks behind;
 And sings a solitary song
 That whistles in the wind.
