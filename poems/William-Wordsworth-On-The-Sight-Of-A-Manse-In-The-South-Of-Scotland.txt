title: On The Sight Of A Manse In The South Of Scotland
---

 Say, ye far-traveled clouds, far-seeing hills
 Among the happiest-looking homes of men
 Scattered all Britain over, through deep glen,
 On airy upland, and by forest rills,
 And o'er wide plains cheered by the lark that trills
 His sky-born warblings, does aught meet your ken
 More fit to animate the Poet's pen,
 Aught that more surely by its aspect fills
 Pure minds with sinless envy, than the Abode
 Of the good Priest: who, faithful through all hours
 To his high charge, and truly serving God,
 Has yet a heart and hand for trees and flowers,
 Enjoys the walks his predecessors trod,
 Nor covets lineal rights in lands and towers.
