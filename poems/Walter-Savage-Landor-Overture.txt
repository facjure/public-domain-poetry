Who will away to Athens with me? who
Loves choral songs and maidens crown�d with flowers,
Unenvious? mount the pinnace; hoist the sail.
I promise ye, as many as are here,
Ye shall not, while ye tarry with me, taste
From unrins�d barrel the diluted wine
Of a low vineyard or a plant ill prun�d,
But such as anciently the Aegean isles
Pour�d in libation at their solemn feasts:
And the same goblets shall ye grasp, emboss�d
With no vile figures of loose languid boors,
But such as gods have liv�d with and have led.
