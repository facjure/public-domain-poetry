I've never sailed the Amazon,
I've never reached Brazil;
But the Don and Magdalena,
They can go there when they will!

Yes, weekly from Southampton
Great steamers, white and gold,
Go rolling down to Rio
(Roll down roll down to Rio!).
And I'd like to roll to Rio
Some day before I'm old!

I've never seen a Jaguar,
Nor yet an Armadill 
He's dilloing in his armour,
And I s'pose I never will,

Unless I go to Rio
These wonders to behold 
Roll down roll down to Rio 
Roll really down to Rio!
Oh, I'd love to roll to Rio
Some day before I'm old!
