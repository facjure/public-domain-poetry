 She had amid her ringlets bound
 Green leaves to rival their dark hue;
 How could such locks with beauty bound
Dry up their dew,
 Wither them through and through?

 She had within her dark eyes lit
 Sweet fires to burn all doubt away;
 Yet did those fires, in darkness lit,
Burn but a day,
 Not even till twilight stay.

 She had within a dusk of words
 A vow in simple splendour set;
 How, in the memory of such words,
Could she forget
 That vow - the soul of it?
