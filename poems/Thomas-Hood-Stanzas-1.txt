Farewell, Life! My senses swim,
And the world is growing dim;
Thronging shadows cloud the light,
Like the advent of the night, - 
Colder, colder, colder still,
Upward steals a vapor chill - 
Strong the earthy odor grows - 
I smell the mould above the rose!

Welcome, Life! the Spirit strives!
Strength returns, and hope revives;
Cloudy fears and shapes forlorn
Fly like shadows at the morn, - 
O'er the earth there comes a bloom - 
Sunny light for sullen gloom,
Warm perfume for vapor cold - 
smell the rose above the mould!

February 1845.
