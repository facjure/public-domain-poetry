 Long has the dew been dried on tree and lawn:
 O'er man and beast a not unwelcome boon
 Is shed, the languor of approaching noon;
 To shady rest withdrawing or withdrawn
 Mute are all creatures, as this couchant fawn,
 Save insect-swarms that hum in air afloat,
 Save that the Cock is crowing, a shrill note,
 Startling and shrill as that which roused the dawn.
 Heard in that hour, or when, as now, the nerve
 Shrinks from the note as from a mistimed thing,
 Oft for a holy warning may it serve,
 Charged with remembrance of 'his' sudden sting,
 His bitter tears, whose name the Papal Chair
 And yon resplendent Church are proud to bear.
