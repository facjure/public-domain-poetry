title: Gold And Silver Fishes In A Vase
---

 The soaring lark is blest as proud
 When at heaven's gate she sings;
 The roving bee proclaims aloud
 Her flight by vocal wings;
 While Ye, in lasting durance pent,
 Your silent lives employ
 For something more than dull content,
 Though haply less than joy.

 Yet might your glassy prison seem
 A place where joy is known, 
 Where golden flash and silver gleam
 Have meanings of their own;
 While, high and low, and all about,
 Your motions, glittering Elves!
 Ye weave, no danger from without,
 And peace among yourselves.

 Type of a sunny human breast
 Is your transparent cell;
 Where Fear is but a transient guest,
 No sullen Humours dwell; 
 Where, sensitive of every ray
 That smites this tiny sea,
 Your scaly panoplies repay
 The loan with usury.

 How beautiful! Yet none knows why
 This ever-graceful change,
 Renewed, renewed incessantly
 Within your quiet range.
 Is it that ye with conscious skill
 For mutual pleasure glide;
 And sometimes, not without your will,
 Are dwarfed, or magnified?

 Fays, Genii of gigantic size!
 And now, in twilight dim,
 Clustering like constellated eyes,
 In wings of Cherubim,
 When the fierce orbs abate their glare;
 Whate'er your forms express,
 Whate'er ye seem, whate'er ye are
 All leads to gentleness.

 Cold though your nature be, 'tis pure,
 Your birthright is a fence
 From all that haughtier kinds endure
 Through tyranny of sense.
 Ah! not alone by colours bright
 Are Ye to heaven allied,
 When, like essential Forms of light,
 Ye mingle, or divide.

 For day-dreams soft as e'er beguiled
 Day-thoughts while limbs repose;
 For moonlight fascinations mild,
 Your gift, ere shutters close
 Accept, mute Captives! thanks and praise;
 And may this tribute prove
 That gentle admirations raise
 Delight resembling love.
