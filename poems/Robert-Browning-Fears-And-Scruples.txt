Here�s my case. Of old I used to love him,
This same unseen friend, before I knew:
Dream there was none like him, none above him,
Wake to hope and trust my dream was true.

Loved I not his letters full of beauty?
Not his actions famous far and wide?
Absent, he would know I vowed him duty;
Present, he would find me at his side.

Pleasant fancy! for I had but letters,
Only knew of actions by hearsay:
He himself was busied with my betters;
What of that? My turn must come some day.

�Some day� proving, no day! Here�s the puzzle.
Passed and passed my turn is. Why complain?
He�s so busied! If I could but muzzle
People�s foolish mouths that give me pain!

�Letters?� (hear them!) �You a judge of writing?
Ask the experts! How they shake the head
O�er these characters, your friend�s inditing,
Call them forgery from A to Z!

�Actions? Where�s your certain proof� (they bother)
�He, of all you find so great and good,
He, he only, claims this, that, the other
Action, claimed by men, a multitude?�

I can simply wish I might refute you,
Wish my friend would, by a word, a wink,
Bid me stop that foolish mouth, you brute you!
He keeps absent, why, I cannot think.

Never mind! Though foolishness may flout me,
One thing�s sure enough: �tis neither frost,
No, nor fire, shall freeze or burn from out me
Thanks for truth, though falsehood, gained, though lost.

All my days, I�ll go the softlier, sadlier,
For that dream�s sake! How forget the thrill
Through and through me as I thought �The gladlier
Lives my friend because I love him still!�

Ah, but there�s a menace some one utters!
�What and if your friend at home play tricks
Peep at hide-and-seek behind the shutters?
Mean your eyes should pierce through solid bricks?

�What and if he, frowning, wake you, dreamy?
Lay on you the blame that bricks, conceal?
Say �At least I saw who did not see me,
Does see now, and presently shall feel�?�

�Why, that makes your friend a monster!� say you:
�Had his house no window? At first nod,
Would you not have hailed him?� Hush, I pray you!
What if this friend happened to be God?
