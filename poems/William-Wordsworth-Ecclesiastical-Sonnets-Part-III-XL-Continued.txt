 Mine ear has rung, my spirit sunk subdued,
 Sharing the strong emotion of the crowd,
 When each pale brow to dread hosannas bowed
 While clouds of incense mounting veiled the rood,
 That glimmered like a pine-tree dimly viewed
 Through Alpine vapours. Such appalling rite
 Our Church prepares not, trusting to the might
 Of simple truth with grace divine imbued;
 Yet will we not conceal the precious Cross,
 Like men ashamed: the Sun with his first smile
 Shall greet that symbol crowning the low Pile:
 And the fresh air of incense-breathing morn
 Shall wooingly embrace it; and green moss
 Creep round its arms through centuries unborn.
