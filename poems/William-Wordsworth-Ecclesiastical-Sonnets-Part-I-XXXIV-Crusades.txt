 The turbaned Race are poured in thickening swarms
 Along the west; though driven from Aquitaine,
 The Crescent glitters on the towers of Spain;
 And soft Italia feels renewed alarms;
 The scimitar, that yields not to the charms
 Of ease, the narrow Bosphorus will disdain;
 Nor long (that crossed) would Grecian hills detain
 Their tents, and check the current of their arms.
 Then blame not those who, by the mightiest lever
 Known to the moral world, Imagination,
 Upheave, so seems it, from her natural station
 All Christendom: they sweep along (was never
 So huge a host!) to tear from the Unbeliever
 The precious Tomb, their haven of salvation.
