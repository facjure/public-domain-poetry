author: William Wordsworth 
title: Sonnets - III. - St. Catherine Of Ledbury
---

 When human touch (as monkish books attest)
 Nor was applied nor could be, Ledbury bells
 Broke forth in concert flung adown the dells,
 And upward, high as Malvern's cloudy crest;
 Sweet tones, and caught by a noble Lady blest
 To rapture! Mabel listened at the side
 Of her loved mistress: soon the music died,
 And Catherine said, "Here I set up my rest."
 Warned in a dream, the Wanderer long had sought
 A home that by such miracle of sound
 Must be revealed: she heard it now, or felt
 The deep, deep joy of a confiding thought;
 And there, a saintly Anchoress, she dwelt
 Till she exchanged for heaven that happy ground.
