 Still, and blanched, and cold, and lone,
 The icy hills far off from me
 With frosty ulys overgrown
 Stand in their sculptured secrecy.

 No path of theirs the chamois fleet
 Treads, with a nostril to the wind;
 O'er their ice-marbled glaciers beat
 No wings of eagles in my mind - 

 Yea, in my mind these mountains rise,
 Their perils dyed with evening's rose;
 And still my ghost sits at my eyes
 And thirsts for their untroubled snows.
