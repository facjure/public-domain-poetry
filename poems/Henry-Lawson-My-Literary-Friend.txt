Once I wrote a little poem which I thought was very fine,
And I showed the printer�s copy to a critic friend of mine,
First he praised the thing a little, then he found a little fault;
�The ideas are good,� he muttered, �but the rhythm seems to halt.�

So I straighten�d up the rhythm where he marked it with his pen,
And I copied it and showed it to my clever friend again.
�You�ve improved the metre greatly, but the rhymes are bad,� he said,
As he read it slowly, scratching surplus wisdom from his head.

So I worked as he suggested (I believe in taking time),
And I burnt the �midnight taper� while I straightened up the rhyme.
�It is better now,� he muttered, �you go on and you�ll succeed,
�It has got a ring about it, the ideas are what you need.�

So I worked for hours upon it (I go on when I commence),
And I kept in view the rhythm and the jingle and the sense,
And I copied it and took it to my solemn friend once more, 
It reminded him of something he had somewhere read before.

Now the people say I�d never put such horrors into print
If I wasn�t too conceited to accept a friendly hint,
And my dearest friends are certain that I�d profit in the end
If I�d always show my copy to a literary friend.
