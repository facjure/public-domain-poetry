title: In The Sound Of Mull

 Tradition, be thou mute! Oblivion, throw
 Thy veil in mercy o'er the records, hung
 Round strath and mountain, stamped by the ancient tongue
 On rock and ruin darkening as we go,
 Spots where a word, ghostlike, survives to show
 What crimes from hate, or desperate love, have sprung;
 From honour misconceived, or fancied wrong,
 What feuds, not quenched but fed by mutual woe.
 Yet, though a wild vindictive Race, untamed
 By civil arts and labours of the pen,
 Could gentleness be scorned by those fierce Men,
 Who, to spread wide the reverence they claimed
 For patriarchal occupations, named
 Yon towering Peaks, "Shepherds of Etive Glen?"
