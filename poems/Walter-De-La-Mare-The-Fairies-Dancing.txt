 I heard along the early hills,
Ere yet the lark was risen up,
 Ere yet the dawn with firelight fills
The night-dew of the bramble-cup, - 
 I heard the fairies in a ring
Sing as they tripped a lilting round
 Soft as the moon on wavering wing.
The starlight shook as if with sound,
 As if with echoing, and the stars
Prankt their bright eyes with trembling gleams
 While red with war the gusty Mars
Rained upon earth his ruddy beams.
 He shone alone, low down the West,
While I, behind a hawthorn-bush,
 Watched on the fairies flaxen-tressed
The fires of the morning flush.
 Till, as a mist, their beauty died,
Their singing shrill and fainter grew;
 And daylight tremulous and wide
Flooded the moorland through and through;
 Till Urdon's copper weathercock
Was reared in golden flame afar,
 And dim from moonlit dreams awoke
The towers and groves of Arroar.
