title: Helen�s Tower

Helen�s tower, here I stand,
Dominant over sea and land.
Son�s love built me, and I hold
Mother�s love in letter�d gold.
Love is in and out of time,
I am mortal stone and lime.
Would my granite girth were strong
As either love, to last as long
I should wear my crown entire
To and thro� the Doomsday fire,
And be found of angel eyes
In earth�s recurring Paradise.
