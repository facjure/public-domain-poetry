 A wolf he pricks with eyes of fire
 Across the night's o'ercrusted snows,
 Seeking his prey,
 He pads his way
 Where Jane benighted goes,
Where Jane benighted goes.

 He curdles the bleak air with ire,
 Ruffling his hoary raiment through,
 And lo! he sees
 Beneath the trees
 Where Jane's light footsteps go,
Where Jane's light footsteps go.

 No hound peals thus in wicked joy,
 He snaps his muzzle in the snows,
 His five-clawed feet
 Do scamper fleet
 Where Jane's bright lanthorn shows,
Where Jane's bright lanthorn shows.

 Now his greed's green doth gaze unseen
 On a pure face of wilding rose,
 Her amber eyes
 In fear's surprise
 Watch largely as she goes,
Watch largely as she goes.

 Salt wells his hunger in his jaws,
 His lust it revels to and fro,
 Yet small beneath
 A soft voice saith,
 'Jane shall in safety go,
Jane shall in safety go.'

 He lurched as if a fiery lash
 Had scourged his hide, and through and through,
 His furious eyes
 O'erscanned the skies,
 But nearer dared not go,
But nearer dared not go.

 He reared like wild Bucephalus,
 His fangs like spears in him uprose,
 Ev'n to the town
 Jane's flitting gown
 He grins on as she goes,
He grins on as she goes.

 In fierce lament he howls amain,
 He scampers, marvelling in his throes
 What brought him there
 To sup on air,
 While Jane unarm�d goes,
While Jane unarm�d goes.
