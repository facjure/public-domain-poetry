I.

Dead!
And the Muses cried with a stormy cry
�Send them no more, for evermore.
Let the people die.�

 
II.

Dead!
�Is it he then brought so low?�
And a careless people flock�d from the fields
With a purse to pay for the show.

 
III.

Dead, who had served his time,
Was one of the people�s kings,
Had labour�d in lifting them out of slime,
And showing them, souls have wings!

 
IV.

Dumb on the winter heath he lay.
His friends had stript him bare,
And roll�d his nakedness everyway
That all the crowd might stare.

 
V.

A storm-worn signpost not to be read,
And a tree with a moulder�d nest
On its barkless bones, stood stark by the dead;
And behind him, low in the West,

 
VI.

With shifting ladders of shadow and light,
And blurr�d in colour and form,
The sun hung over the gates of Night,
And glared at a coming storm.

 
VII.

Then glided a vulturous Beldam forth,
That on dumb death had thriven;
They call�d her �Reverence� here upon earth,
And �The Curse of the Prophet� in Heaven.

 
VIII.

She knelt��We worship him��all but wept�
�So great so noble was he!�
She clear�d her sight, she arose, she swept
The dust of earth from her knee.

 
IX.

�Great! for he spoke and the people heard,
And his eloquence caught like a flame
From zone to zone of the world, till his Word
Had won him a noble name.

 
X.

Noble! he sung, and the sweet sound ran
Thro� palace and cottage door,
For he touch�d on the whole sad planet of man,
The kings and the rich and the poor;

 
XI.

And he sung not alone of an old sun set,
But a sun coming up in his youth!
Great and noble�O yes�but yet�
For man is a lover of Truth,

 
XII.

And bound to follow, wherever she go
Stark-naked, and up or down,
Thro� her high hill-passes of stainless snow,
Or the foulest sewer of the town�

 
XIII.

Noble and great�O ay�but then,
Tho� a prophet should have his due,
Was he noblier-fashion�d than other men?
Shall we see to it, I and you?

 
XIV.

For since he would sit on a Prophet�s seat,
As a lord of the Human soul,
We needs must scan him from head to feet
Were it but for a wart or a mole?�

 
XV.

His wife and his child stood by him in tears,
But she�she push�d them aside.
�Tho� a name may last for a thousand years,
Yet a truth is a truth,� she cried.

 
XVI.

And she that had haunted his pathway still,
Had often truckled and cower�d
When he rose in his wrath, and had yielded her will
To the master, as overpower�d,

 
XVII.

She tumbled his helpless corpse about.
�Small blemish upon the skin!
But I think we know what is fair without
Is often as foul within.�

 
XVIII.

She crouch�d, she tore him part from part,
And out of his body she drew
The red �Blood-eagle� of liver and heart;
She held them up to the view;

 
XIX.

She gabbled, as she groped in the dead,
And all the people were pleased;
�See, what a little heart,� she said,
�And the liver is half-diseased!�

 
XX.

She tore the Prophet after death,
And the people paid her well.
Lightnings flicker�d along the heath;
One shriek�d �The fires of Hell!�
