title: Just You
---

All the selfish joys of earth,
 I am getting through.
That which used to lure and lead
 Now I pass and give no heed;
Only one thing seems of worth - 
Just you.

Not for me the lonely height,
 And the larger view;
Lowlier ways seem fair and wide,
 While we wander side by side.
One thing makes the whole world bright - 
Just you.

Not for distant goals I run,
 No great aim pursue;
Most of earth's ambitions seem
 Like the shadow of a dream.
All the world to me means one - 
Just you.
