1.

But Los saw the Female &amp; pitied
He embrac'd her, she wept, she refus'd
In perverse and cruel delight
She fled from his arms, yet he followd

2.

Eternity shudder'd when they saw,
Man begetting his likeness,
On his own divided image.

3.

A time passed over, the Eternals
Began to erect the tent;
When Enitharmon sick,
Felt a Worm within her womb.

4.

Yet helpless it lay like a Worm
In the trembling womb
To be moulded into existence

5.

All day the worm lay on her bosom
All night within her womb
The worm lay till it grew to a serpent
With dolorous hissings &amp; poisons
Round Enitharmons loins folding,

6.

Coild within Enitharmons womb
The serpent grew casting its scales,
With sharp pangs the hissings began
To change to a grating cry,
Many sorrows and dismal throes,
Many forms of fish, bird &amp; beast,
Brought forth an Infant form
Where was a worm before.

7.

The Eternals their tent finished
Alarm'd with these gloomy visions
When Enitharmon groaning
Produc'd a man Child to the light.

8.

A shriek ran thro' Eternity:
And a paralytic stroke;
At the birth of the Human shadow.

9.

Delving earth in his resistless way;
Howling, the Child with fierce flames
Issu'd from Enitharmon.

10.

The Eternals, closed the tent
They beat down the stakes the cords
Stretch'd for a work of eternity;
No more Los beheld Eternity.

11.

In his hands he seiz'd the infant
He bathed him in springs of sorrow
He gave him to Enitharmon.
