 There is a garden, grey
With mists of autumntide;
 Under the giant boughs,
Stretched green on every side,

 Along the lonely paths,
A little child like me,
 With face, with hands, like mine,
Plays ever silently;

 On, on, quite silently,
When I am there alone,
 Turns not his head; lifts not his eyes;
Heeds not as he plays on.

 After the birds are flown
From singing in the trees,
 When all is grey, all silent,
Voices, and winds, and bees;

 And I am there alone:
Forlornly, silently,
 Plays in the evening garden
Myself with me.
