Three damsels in the queen�s chamber,
The queen�s mouth was most fair;
She spake a word of God�s mother
As the combs went in her hair.
Mary that is of might,
Bring us to thy Son�s sight.

They held the gold combs out from her,
A span�s length off her head;
She sang this song of God�s mother
And of her bearing-bed.
Mary most full of grace,
Bring us to thy Son�s face.

When she sat at Joseph�s hand,
She looked against her side;
And either way from the short silk band
Her girdle was all wried.
Mary that all good may,
Bring us to thy Son�s way.

Mary had three women for her bed,
The twain were maidens clean;
The first of them had white and red,
The third had riven green.
Mary that is so sweet,
Bring us to thy Son�s feet.

She had three women for her hair,
Two were gloved soft and shod;
The third had feet and fingers bare,
She was the likest God.
Mary that wieldeth land,
Bring us to thy Son�s hand.

She had three women for her ease,
The twain were good women:
The first two were the two Maries,
The third was Magdalen.
Mary that perfect is,
Bring us to thy Son�s kiss.

Joseph had three workmen in his stall,
To serve him well upon;
The first of them were Peter and Paul,
The third of them was John.
Mary, God�s handmaiden,
Bring us to thy Son�s ken.

�If your child be none other man�s,
But if it be very mine,
The bedstead shall be gold two spans,
The bedfoot silver fine.�
Mary that made God mirth,
Bring us to thy Son�s birth.

�If the child be some other man�s,
And if it be none of mine,
The manger shall be straw two spans,
Betwixen kine and kine.�
Mary that made sin cease,
Bring us to thy Son�s peace.

Christ was born upon this wise,
It fell on such a night,
Neither with sounds of psalteries,
Nor with fire for light.
Mary that is God�s spouse,
Bring us to thy Son�s house.

The star came out upon the east
With a great sound and sweet:
Kings gave gold to make him feast
And myrrh for him to eat.
Mary, of thy sweet mood,
Bring us to thy Son�s good.

He had two handmaids at his head,
One handmaid at his feet;
The twain of them were fair and red,
The third one was right sweet.
Mary that is most wise,
Bring us to thy Son�s eyes. Amen.
