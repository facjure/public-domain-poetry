title: Hark! 'Tis The Thrush, Undaunted, Undeprest
---

 Hark! 'tis the Thrush, undaunted, undeprest,
 By twilight premature of cloud and rain;
 Nor does that roaring wind deaden his strain
 Who carols thinking of his Love and nest,
 And seems, as more incited, still more blest.
 Thanks; thou hast snapped a fireside Prisoner's chain,
 Exulting Warbler! eased a fretted brain,
 And in a moment charmed my cares to rest.
 Yes, I will forth, bold Bird! and front the blast,
 That we may sing together, if thou wilt,
 So loud, so clear, my Partner through life's day,
 Mute in her nest love-chosen, if not love-built
 Like thine, shall gladden, as in seasons past,
 Thrilled by loose snatches of the social Lay.
