 Roses are sweet to smell and see,
And lilies on the stem;
 But rarer, stranger buds there be,
And she was like to them.

 The little moon that April brings,
More lovely shade than light,
 That, setting, silvers lonely hills
Upon the verge of night - 

 Close to the world of my poor heart
So stole she, still and clear;
 Now that she's gone, O dark, and dark,
The solitude, the fear.
