 Lament! for Diocletian's fiery sword
 Works busy as the lightning; but instinct
 With malice ne'er to deadliest weapon linked
 Which God's ethereal store-houses afford:
 Against the Followers of the incarnate Lord
 It rages; some are smitten in the field
 Some pierced to the heart through the ineffectual shield
 Of sacred home; with pomp are others gored
 And dreadful respite. Thus was Alban tried,
 England's first Martyr, whom no threats could shake;
 Self-offered victim, for his friend he died,
 And for the faith; nor shall his name forsake
 That Hill, whose flowery platform seems to rise
 By Nature decked for holiest sacrifice.
