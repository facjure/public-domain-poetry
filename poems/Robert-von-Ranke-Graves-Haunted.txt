 Gulp down your wine, old friends of mine,
 Roar through the darkness, stamp and sing
 And lay ghost hands on everything,
 But leave the noonday's warm sunshine
 To living lads for mirth and wine.

 I met you suddenly down the street,
 Strangers assume your phantom faces,
 You grin at me from daylight places,
 Dead, long dead, I'm ashamed to greet
 Dead men down the morning street.
