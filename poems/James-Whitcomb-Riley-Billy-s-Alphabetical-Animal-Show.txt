 A was an elegant Ape
 Who tied up his ears with red tape,
And wore a long veil
Half revealing his tail
 Which was trimmed with jet bugles and crape.

 B was a boastful old Bear
 Who used to say, - "Hoomh! I declare
I can eat - if you'll get me
The children, and let me -
 Ten babies, teeth, toenails and hair!"

 C was a Codfish who sighed
 When snatched from the home of his pride,
But could he, embrined,
Guess this fragrance behind,
 How glad he would be that he died!

 D was a dandified Dog
 Who said, - "Though it's raining like fog
I wear no umbrellah,
Me boy, for a fellah
 Might just as well travel incog!"

 E was an elderly Eel
 Who would say, - "Well, I really feel -
As my grandchildren wriggle
And shout 'I should giggle' -
 A trifle run down at the heel!"

 F was a Fowl who conceded
 Some hens might hatch more eggs than she did, -
But she'd children as plenty
As eighteen or twenty,
 And that was quite all that she needed.

 G was a gluttonous Goat
 Who, dining one day, table-d'hote,
Ordered soup-bone, au fait,
And fish, papier-mache,
 And a filet of Spring overcoat.

 H was a high-cultured Hound
 Who could clear forty feet at a bound,
And a coon once averred
That his howl could be heard
 For five miles and three-quarters around.

 I was an Ibex ambitious
 To dive over chasms auspicious;
He would leap down a peak
And not light for a week,
 And swear that the jump was delicious.

 J was a Jackass who said
 He had such a bad cold in his head,
If it wasn't for leaving
The rest of us grieving,
 He'd really rather be dead.

 K was a profligate Kite
 Who would haunt the saloons every night;
And often he ust
To reel back to his roost
 Too full to set up on it right.

 L was a wary old Lynx
 Who would say, - "Do you know wot I thinks? -
I thinks ef you happen
To ketch me a-nappin'
 I'm ready to set up the drinks!"

 M was a merry old Mole,
 Who would snooze all the day in his hole,
Then - all night, a-rootin'
Around and galootin' -
 He'd sing "Johnny, Fill up the Bowl!"

 N was a caustical Nautilus
 Who sneered, "I suppose, when they've caught all us,
Like oysters they'll serve us,
And can us, preserve us,
 And barrel, and pickle, and bottle us!"

 O was an autocrat Owl -
 Such a wise - such a wonderful fowl!
Why, for all the night through
He would hoot and hoo-hoo,
 And hoot and hoo-hooter and howl!

 P was a Pelican pet,
 Who gobbled up all he could get;
He could eat on until
He was full to the bill,
 And there he had lodgings to let!

 Q was a querulous Quail,
 Who said: "It will little avail
The efforts of those
Of my foes who propose
 To attempt to put salt on my tail!"

 R was a ring-tailed Raccoon,
 With eyes of the tinge of the moon,
And his nose a blue-black,
And the fur on his back
 A sad sort of sallow maroon.

 S is a Sculpin - you'll wish
 Very much to have one on your dish,
Since all his bones grow
On the outside, and so
 He's a very desirable fish.

 T was a Turtle, of wealth,
 Who went round with particular stealth, -
"Why," said he, "I'm afraid
Of being waylaid
 When I even walk out for my health!"

 U was a Unicorn curious,
 With one horn, of a growth so luxurious,
He could level and stab it -
If you didn't grab it -
 Clean through you, he was so blamed furious!

 V was a vagabond Vulture
 Who said: "I don't want to insult yer,
But when you intrude
Where in lone solitude
 I'm a-preyin', you're no man o' culture!"

 W was a wild Woodchuck,
 And you can just bet that he could "chuck"
He'd eat raw potatoes,
Green corn, and tomatoes,
 And tree roots, and call it all "good chuck!"

 X was a kind of X-cuse
 Of a some-sort-o'-thing that got loose
Before we could name it,
And cage it, and tame it,
 And bring it in general use.

 Y is the Yellowbird, - bright
 As a petrified lump of star-light,
Or a handful of lightning-
Bugs, squeezed in the tight'ning
 Pink fist of a boy, at night.

 Z is the Zebra, of course! -
 A kind of a clown-of-a-horse, -
Each other despising,
Yet neither devising
 A way to obtain a divorce!

 &amp; here is the famous - what-is-it?
 Walk up, Master Billy, and quiz it:
You've seen the rest of 'em -
Ain't this the best of 'em,
 Right at the end of your visit?
