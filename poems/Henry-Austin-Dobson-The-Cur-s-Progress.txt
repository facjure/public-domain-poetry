title: The Cur�'s Progress.
---

Monsieur the Cur� down the street
Comes with his kind old face,--
With his coat worn bare, and his straggling hair,
And his green umbrella-case.

You may see him pass by the little "Grande Place,"
And the tiny "H�tel-de-Ville";
He smiles, as he goes, to the fleuriste Rose,
And the pompier Th�ophile.

He turns, as a rule, through the "March�" cool,
Where the noisy fish-wives call;
And his compliment pays to the "Belle Th�r�se,"
As she knits in her dusky stall.

There's a letter to drop at the locksmith's shop,
And Toto, the locksmith's niece,
Has jubilant hopes, for the Cur� gropes
In his tails for a pain d'�pice.

There's a little dispute with a merchant of fruit,
Who is said to be heterodox,
That will ended be with a "Ma foi, oui!"
And a pinch from the Cur�'s box.

There is also a word that no one heard
To the furrier's daughter Lou;
And a pale cheek fed with a flickering red,
And a "Bon Dieu garde M'sieu!"

But a grander way for the Sous-Pr�fet,
And a bow for Ma'am'selle Anne;
And a mock "off-hat" to the Notary's cat,
And a nod to the Sacristan:--

For ever through life the Cur� goes
With a smile on his kind old face--
With his coat worn bare, and his straggling hair,
And his green umbrella-case.
