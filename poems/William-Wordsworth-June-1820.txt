 Fame tells of groves, from England far away,
 Groves that inspire the Nightingale to trill
 And modulate, with subtle reach of skill
 Elsewhere unmatched, her ever-varying lay;
 Such bold report I venture to gainsay:
 For I have heard the quire of Richmond hill
 Chanting, with indefatigable bill,
 Strains that recalled to mind a distant day;
 When, haply under shade of that same wood,
 And scarcely conscious of the dashing oars
 Plied steadily between those willowy shores,
 The sweet-souled Poet of the Seasons stood
 Listening, and listening long, in rapturous mood,
 Ye heavenly Birds! to your Progenitors.
