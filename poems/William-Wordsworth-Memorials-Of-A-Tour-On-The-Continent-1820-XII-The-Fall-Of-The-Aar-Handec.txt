 From the fierce aspect of this River, throwing
 His giant body o'er the steep rock's brink,
 Back in astonishment and fear we shrink:
 But, gradually a calmer look bestowing,
 Flowers we espy beside the torrent growing;
 Flowers that peep forth from many a cleft and chink,
 And, from the whirlwind of his anger, drink
 Hues ever fresh, in rocky fortress blowing:
 They suck from breath that, threatening to destroy,
 Is more benignant than the dewy eve
 Beauty, and life, and motions as of joy:
 Nor doubt but He to whom yon Pine-trees nod
 Their heads in sign of worship, Nature's God,
 These humbler adorations will receive.
