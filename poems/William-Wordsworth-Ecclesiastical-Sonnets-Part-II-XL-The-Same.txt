 Holy and heavenly Spirits as they are,
 Spotless in life, and eloquent as wise,
 With what entire affection do they prize
 Their Church reformed! labouring with earnest care
 To baffle all that may her strength impair;
 That Church, the unperverted Gospel's seat;
 In their afflictions a divine retreat;
 Source of their liveliest hope, and tenderest prayer!
 The truth exploring with an equal mind,
 In doctrine and communion they have sought
 Firmly between the two extremes to steer;
 But theirs the wise man's ordinary lot
 To trace right courses for the stubborn blind,
 And prophesy to ears that will not hear.
