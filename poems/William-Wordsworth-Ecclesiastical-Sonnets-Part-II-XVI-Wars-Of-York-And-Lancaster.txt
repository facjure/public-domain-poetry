 Thus is the storm abated by the craft
 Of a shrewd Counselor, eager to protect
 The Church, whose power hath recently been checked,
 Whose monstrous riches threatened. So the shaft
 Of victory mounts high, and blood is quaffed
 In fields that rival Cressy and Poictiers
 Pride to be washed away by bitter tears!
 For deep as Hell itself, the avenging draught
 Of civil slaughter. Yet, while temporal power
 Is by these shocks exhausted, spiritual truth
 Maintains the else endangered gift of life;
 Proceeds from infancy to lusty youth;
 And, under cover of this woeful strife,
 Gathers unblighted strength from hour to hour.
