---

 For gentlest uses, oft-times Nature takes
 The work of Fancy from her willing hands;
 And such a beautiful creation makes
 As renders needless spells and magic wands,
 And for the boldest tale belief commands.
 When first mine eyes beheld that famous Hill,
 The sacred Engelberg, celestial Bands,
 With intermingling motions soft and still,
 Hung round its top, on wings that changed their hues at will.

 Clouds do not name those Visitants; they were
 The very Angels whose authentic lays,
 Sung from that heavenly ground in middle air,
 Made known the spot where piety should raise
 A holy Structure to the Almighty's praise.
 Resplendent Apparition! if in vain
 My ears did listen, 'twas enough to gaze;
 And watch the slow departure of the train,
 Whose skirts the glowing Mountain thirsted to detain.
