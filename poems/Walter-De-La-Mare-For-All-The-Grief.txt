title: For All The Grief
---

 For all the grief I have given with words
May now a few clear flowers blow,
 In the dust, and the heat, and the silence of birds,
 Where the lonely go.

 For the thing unsaid that heart asked of me
Be a dark, cool water calling - calling
 To the footsore, benighted, solitary,
 When the shadows are falling.

 O, be beauty for all my blindness,
A moon in the air where the weary wend,
 And dews burdened with loving-kindness
 In the dark of the end.
