In high Olympus' sacred shade
 A gift Minerva wrought
For her beloved philosopher
 Immersed in deepest thought.

A shield to guard his aged breast
 With its enchanted mesh
When he his nectar and ambrosia took
 To strengthen and refresh.

Long may he live to use the life
 The hidden goddess gave,
To keep unspotted to the end
 The gentle, just, and brave.

December, 1887.
