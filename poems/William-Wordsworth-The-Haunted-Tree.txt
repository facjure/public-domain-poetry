 Those silver clouds collected round the sun
 His mid-day warmth abate not, seeming less
 To overshade than multiply his beams
 By soft reflection, grateful to the sky,
 To rocks, fields, woods. Nor doth our human sense
 Ask, for its pleasure, screen or canopy
 More ample than the time-dismantled Oak
 Spreads o'er this tuft of heath, which now, attired
 In the whole fulness of its bloom, affords
 Couch beautiful as e'er for earthly use
 Was fashioned; whether, by the hand of Art,
 That eastern Sultan, amid flowers enwrought
 On silken tissue, might diffuse his limbs
 In languor; or, by Nature, for repose
 Of panting Wood-nymph, wearied with the chase.
 O Lady! fairer in thy Poet's sight
 Than fairest spiritual creature of the groves,
 Approach; and, thus invited, crown with rest
 The noon-tide hour: though truly some there are
 Whose footsteps superstitiously avoid
 This venerable Tree; for, when the wind
 Blows keenly, it sends forth a creaking sound
 (Above the general roar of woods and crags)
 Distinctly heard from far, a doleful note!
 As if (so Grecian shepherds would have deemed)
 The Hamadryad, pent within, bewailed
 Some bitter wrong. Nor is it unbelieved,
 By ruder fancy, that a troubled ghost
 Haunts the old trunk; lamenting deeds of which
 The flowery ground is conscious. But no wind
 Sweeps now along this elevated ridge;
 Not even a zephyr stirs; the obnoxious Tree
 Is mute; and, in his silence, would look down,
 O lovely Wanderer of the trackless hills,
 On thy reclining form with more delight
 Than his coevals in the sheltered vale
 Seem to participate, the while they view
 Their own far-stretching arms and leafy heads
 Vividly pictured in some glassy pool,
 That, for a brief space, checks the hurrying stream!
