 Closing the sacred Book which long has fed
 Our meditations, give we to a day
 Of annual joy one tributary lay;
 This day, when, forth by rustic music led,
 The village Children, while the sky is red
 With evening lights, advance in long array
 Through the still churchyard, each with garland gay,
 That, carried sceptre-like, o'ertops the head
 Of the proud Bearer. To the wide church-door,
 Charged with these offerings which their fathers bore
 For decoration in the Papal time,
 The innocent procession softly moves: 
 The spirit of Laud is pleased in heaven's pure clime,
 And Hooker's voice the spectacle approves!
