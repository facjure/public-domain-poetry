 Through the green twilight of a hedge
 I peered, with cheek on the cool leaves pressed,
 And spied a bird upon a nest:
 Two eyes she had beseeching me
 Meekly and brave, and her brown breast
 Throbb'd hot and quick above her heart;
 And then she oped her dagger bill, - 
 'Twas not a chirp, as sparrows pipe
 At break of day; 'twas not a trill,
 As falters through the quiet even;
 But one sharp solitary note,
 One desperate, fierce, and vivid cry
 Of valiant tears, and hopeless joy,
 One passionate note of victory:
 Off, like a fool afraid, I sneaked,
 Smiling the smile the fool smiles best,
 At the mother bird in the secret hedge
 Patient upon her lonely nest.
