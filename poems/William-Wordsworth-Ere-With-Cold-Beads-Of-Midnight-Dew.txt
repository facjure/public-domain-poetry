title: Ere With Cold Beads Of Midnight Dew
---

 Ere with cold beads of midnight dew
 Had mingled tears of thine,
 I grieved, fond Youth! that thou shouldst sue
 To haughty Geraldine.

 Immoveable by generous sighs,
 She glories in a train
 Who drag, beneath our native skies,
 An oriental chain.

 Pine not like them with arms across,
 Forgetting in thy care
 How the fast-rooted trees can toss
 Their branches in mid air.

 The humblest rivulet will take
 Its own wild liberties;
 And, every day, the imprisoned lake
 Is flowing in the breeze.

 Then, crouch no more on suppliant knee,
 But scorn with scorn outbrave;
 A Briton, even in love, should be
 A subject, not a slave!
