Part II. To the close of the Troubles in the Reign of Charles I


 How soon, alas! did Man, created pure
 By Angels guarded, deviate from the line
 Prescribed to duty: woeful forfeiture
 He made by willful breach of law divine.
 With like perverseness did the Church abjure
 Obedience to her Lord, and haste to twine,
 'Mid Heaven-born flowers that shall for aye endure,
 Weeds on whose front the world had fixed her sign.
 O Man, if with thy trials thus it fares,
 If good can smooth the way to evil choice,
 From all rash censure be the mind kept free;
 He only judges right who weighs, compares,
 And in the sternest sentence which his voice
 Pronounces, ne'er abandons Charity.
