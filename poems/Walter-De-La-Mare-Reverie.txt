 Bring not bright candles, for his eyes
In twilight have sweet company;
 Bring not bright candles, else they fly - 
His phantoms fly - 
 Gazing aggrieved on thee!

 Bring not bright candles, startle not
The phantoms of a vacant room,
 Flocking above a child that dreams - 
Deep, deep in dreams, - 
 Hid, in the gathering gloom!

 Bring not bright candles to those eyes
That between earth and stars descry,
 Lovelier for the shadows there,
Children of air,
 Palaces in the sky!
