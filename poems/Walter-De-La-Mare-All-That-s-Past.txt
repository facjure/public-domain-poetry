 Very old are the woods;
And the buds that break
 Out of the briar's boughs,
When March winds wake,
 So old with their beauty are - 
Oh, no man knows
 Through what wild centuries
Roves back the rose.

 Very old are the brooks;
And the rills that rise
 Where snow sleeps cold beneath
The azure skies
 Sing such a history
Of come and gone,
 Their every drop is as wise
As Solomon.

 Very old are we men;
Our dreams are tales
 Told in dim Eden
By Eve's nightingales;
 We wake and whisper awhile,
But, the day gone by,
 Silence and sleep like fields
Of amaranth lie.
