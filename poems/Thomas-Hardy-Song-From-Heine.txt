title: Song From Heine
---

I scanned her picture dreaming,
 Till each dear line and hue
Was imaged, to my seeming,
 As if it lived anew.

Her lips began to borrow
 Their former wondrous smile;
Her fair eyes, faint with sorrow,
 Grew sparkling as erstwhile.

Such tears as often ran not
 Ran then, my love, for thee;
And O, believe I cannot
 That thou are lost to me!
