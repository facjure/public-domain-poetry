With rosy hand a little girl press�d down
A boss of fresh-cull�d cowslips in a rill:
Often as they sprang up again, a frown
Show�d she dislik�d resistance to her will:
But when they droop�d their heads and shone much less,
She shook them to and fro, and threw them by,
And tripp�d away. �Ye loathe the heaviness
Ye love to cause, my little girls!� thought I,
�And what has shone for you, by you must die!�
