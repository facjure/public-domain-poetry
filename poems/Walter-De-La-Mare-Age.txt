 This ugly old crone - 
 Every beauty she had
 When a maid, when a maid.
 Her beautiful eyes,
 Too youthful, too wise,
 Seemed ever to come
 To so lightless a home,
 Cold and dull as a stone.
 And her cheeks - who would guess
 Cheeks cadaverous as this
 Once with colours were gay
 As the flower on its spray?
 Who would ever believe
 Aught could bring one to grieve
 So much as to make
 Lips bent for love's sake
 So thin and so grey?
 O Youth, come away!
 As she asks in her lone,
 This old, desolate crone.
 She loves us no more;
 She is too old to care
 For the charms that of yore
 Made her body so fair.
 Past repining, past care,
 She lives but to bear
 One or two fleeting years
 Earth's indifference: her tears
 Have lost now their heat;
 Her hands and her feet
 Now shake but to be
 Shed as leaves from a tree;
 And her poor heart beats on
 Like a sea - the storm gone.
