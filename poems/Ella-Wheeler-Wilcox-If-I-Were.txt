title: If I Were
---

If I were a raindrop, and you were a leaf,
 I would burst from the cloud above you,
And lie on your breast in a rapture of rest,
 And love you, love you, love you.

If I were a brown bee, and you were a rose,
 I would fly to you, love, nor miss you;
I would sip and sip from your nectared lip,
 And kiss you, kiss you, kiss you.

If I were a doe, dear, and you were a brook,
 Ah, what would I do then, think you?
I would kneel by the bank, in the grasses dank,
 And drink you, drink you, drink you.
