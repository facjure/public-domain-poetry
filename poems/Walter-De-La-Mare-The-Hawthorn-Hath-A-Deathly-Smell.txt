title: The Hawthorn Hath A Deathly Smell
---

 The flowers of the field
Have a sweet smell;
 Meadowsweet, tansy, thyme,
And faint-heart pimpernel;
 But sweeter even than these,
The silver of the may
 Wreathed is with incense for
The Judgment Day.

 An apple, a child, dust,
When falls the evening rain,
 Wild briar's spic�d leaves,
Breathe memories again;
 With further memory fraught,
The silver of the may
 Wreathed is with incense for
The Judgment Day.

 Eyes of all loveliness - 
Shadow of strange delight,
 Even as a flower fades
Must thou from sight;
 But oh, o'er thy grave's mound,
Till come the Judgment Day,
 Wreathed shall with incense be
Thy sharp-thorned may.
