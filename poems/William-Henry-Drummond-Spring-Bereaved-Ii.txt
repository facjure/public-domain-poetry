Sweet Spring, thou turn�st with all thy goodly train,
Thy head with flames, thy mantle bright with flow�rs:
The zephyrs curl the green locks of the plain,
The clouds for joy in pearls weep down their show�rs.
Thou turn�st, sweet youth, but ah! my pleasant hours
And happy days with thee come not again;
The sad memorials only of my pain
Do with thee turn, which turn my sweets in sours.
Thou art the same which still thou wast before,
Delicious, wanton, amiable, fair;
But she, whose breath embalm�d thy wholesome air,
Is gone, nor gold nor gems her can restore.
Neglected virtue, seasons go and come,
