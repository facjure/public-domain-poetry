---

 Jesu! bless our slender Boat,
 By the current swept along;
 Loud its threatenings, let them not
 Drown the music of a song
 Breathed thy mercy to implore,
 Where these troubled waters roar!

 Saviour, for our warning, seen
 Bleeding on that precious Rood;
 If, while through the meadows green
 Gently wound the peaceful flood,
 We forgot Thee, do not Thou
 Disregard thy Suppliants now!

 Hither, like yon ancient Tower
 Watching o'er the River's bed,
 Fling the shadow of thy power,
 Else we sleep among the dead;
 Thou who trod'st the billowy sea,
 Shield us in our jeopardy!

 Guide our Bark among the waves;
 Through the rocks our passage smooth;
 Where the whirlpool frets and raves
 Let thy love its anger soothe:
 All our hope is placed in Thee;
 'Miserere Domine!'
