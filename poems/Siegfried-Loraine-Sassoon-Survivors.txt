No doubt they'll soon get well; the shock and strain
 Have caused their stammering, disconnected talk.
Of course they're "longing to go out again," - 
 These boys with old, scared faces, learning to walk,
They'll soon forget their haunted nights; their cowed
 Subjection to the ghosts of friends who died, - 
Their dreams that drip with murder; and they'll be proud
 Of glorious war that shatter'd all their pride ...
Men who went out to battle, grim and glad;
Children, with eyes that hate you, broken and mad.

 CRAIGLOCKART,
Oct. 1917.
