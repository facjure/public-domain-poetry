title: To The Pennsylvanians
---

 Days undefiled by luxury or sloth,
 Firm self-denial, manners grave and staid,
 Rights equal, laws with cheerfulness obeyed,
 Words that require no sanction from an oath,
 And simple honesty a common growth,
 This high repute, with bounteous Nature's aid,
 Won confidence, now ruthlessly betrayed
 At will, your power the measure of your troth!
 All who revere the memory of Penn
 Grieve for the land on whose wild woods his name
 Was fondly grafted with a virtuous aim,
 Renounced, abandoned by degenerate Men
 For state-dishonour black as ever came
 To upper air from Mammon's loathsome den.
