title: Ecclesiastical Sonnets - Part I. - XXXII - Coldly We Spake
---

 Coldly we spake. The Saxons, overpowered
 By wrong triumphant through its own excess,
 From fields laid waste, from house and home devoured
 By flames, look up to heaven and crave redress
 From God's eternal justice. Pitiless
 Though men be, there are angels that can feel
 For wounds that death alone has power to heal,
 For penitent guilt, and innocent distress.
 And has a Champion risen in arms to try
 His Country's virtue, fought, and breathes no more;
 Him in their hearts the people canonize;
 And far above the mine's most precious ore
 The least small pittance of bare mould they prize
 Scooped from the sacred earth where his dear relics lie.
