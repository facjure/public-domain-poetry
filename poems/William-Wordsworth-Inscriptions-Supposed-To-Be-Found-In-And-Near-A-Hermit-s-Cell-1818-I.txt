 Hopes what are they? Beads of morning
 Strung on slender blades of grass;
 Or a spider's web adorning
 In a strait and treacherous pass.

 What are fears but voices airy?
 Whispering harm where harm is not;
 And deluding the unwary
 Till the fatal bolt is shot!

 What is glory? in the socket
 See how dying tapers fare!
 What is pride? a whizzing rocket
 That would emulate a star.

 What is friendship? do not trust her,
 Nor the vows which she has made;
 Diamonds dart their brightest lustre
 From a palsy-shaken head.

 What is truth? a staff rejected;
 Duty? an unwelcome clog;
 Joy? a moon by fits reflected
 In a swamp or watery bog;

 Bright, as if through ether steering,
 To the Traveller's eye it shone:
 He hath hailed it re-appearing,
 And as quickly it is gone;

 Such is Joy, as quickly hidden,
 Or mis-shapen to the sight,
 And by sullen weeds forbidden
 To resume its native light.

 What is youth? a dancing billow,
 (Winds behind, and rocks before!)
 Age? a drooping, tottering willow
 On a flat and lazy shore.

 What is peace? when pain is over,
 And love ceases to rebel,
 Let the last faint sigh discover
 That precedes the passing knell!
