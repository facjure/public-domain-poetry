 SCENE. Before the temporary abode of Heracles in Trachis.




 This tragedy is named from the Chorus. From the subject it might have been called 'Deanira or the Death of Heracles'.

 The Centaur Nessus, in dying by the arrow of Heracles, which had been dipped in the venom of the Hydra, persuaded the bride Deanira, whose beauty was the cause of his death, to keep some of the blood from the wound as a love-charm for her husband. Many years afterwards, when Heracles was returning from his last exploit of sacking Oechalia, in Euboea, he sent before him, by his herald Lichas, Iole, the king's daughter, whom he had espoused. Deanira, when she had discovered this, commissioned Lichas when he returned to present his master with a robe, which she had anointed with the charm,--hoping by this means to regain her lord's affection. But the poison of the Hydra did its work, and Heracles died in agony, Deanira having already killed herself on ascertaining what she had done. The action takes place in Trachis, near the Mahae Gulf, where Heracles and Deanira, by permission of Ceyx, the king of the country, have been living in exile. At the close of the drama, Heracles, while yet alive, is carried towards his pyre on Mount Oeta.




 THE TRACHINIAN MAIDENS


 D�ANIRA. Men say,--'twas old experience gave the word,
 --'No lot of mortal, ere he die, can once
 Be known for good or evil.' But I know,
 Before I come to the dark dwelling-place,
 Mine is a lot, adverse and hard and sore.
 Who yet at Pleuron, in my father's home,
 Of all Aetolian women had most cause
 To fear my bridal. For a river-god,
 Swift Achel��s, was my suitor there
 And sought me from my father in three forms;
 Now in his own bull-likeness, now a serpent
 Of coiling sheen, and now with manlike build
 But bovine front, while from the shadowy beard
 Sprang fountain-waters in perpetual spray.
 Looking for such a husband, I, poor girl!
 Still prayed that Death might find me, ere I knew
 That nuptial.--Later, to my glad relief,
 Zeus' and Alcmena's glorious offspring came,
 And closed with him in conflict, and released
 My heart from torment. How the fight was won
 I could not tell. If any were who saw
 Unshaken of dread foreboding, such may speak.
 But I sate quailing with an anguished fear,
 Lest beauty might procure me nought but pain,
 Till He that rules the issue of all strife,
 Gave fortunate end--if fortunate! For since,
 Assigned by that day's conquest, I have known
 The couch of Heracles, my life is spent
 In one continual terror for his fate.
 Night brings him, and, ere morning, some fresh toil
 Drives him afar. And I have borne him seed;
 Which he, like some strange husbandman that farms
 A distant field, finds but at sowing time
 And once in harvest. Such a weary life
 Still tossed him to and fro,--no sooner home
 But forth again, serving I know not whom.
 And when his glorious head had risen beyond
 These labours, came the strongest of my fear.
 For since he quelled the might of Iphitus,
 We here in Trachis dwell, far from our home,
 Dependent on a stranger, but where he
 Is gone, none knoweth. Only this I know,
 His going pierced my heart with pangs for him,
 And now I am all but sure he bears some woe.
 These fifteen months he hath sent me not one word.
 And I have cause for fear. Ere he set forth
 He left a scroll with me, whose dark intent
 I oft pray Heaven may bring no sorrow down.

 ATTENDANT. Queen D�anira, many a time ere now
 Have I beheld thee with all tearful moan
 Bewailing the departure of thy lord.
 But, if it be permitted that a slave
 Should tender counsel to the free, my voice
 May venture this:--Of thy strong band of sons
 Why is not one commissioned to explore
 For Heracles? and why not Hyllus first,
 Whom most it would beseem to show regard
 For tidings of his father's happiness?
 Ah! here I see him bounding home, with feet
 Apt for employment! If you count me wise,
 He and my words attend upon your will.

 Enter HYLLUS.

 D�. Dear child, dear boy! even from the lowliest head
 Wise counsel may come forth. This woman here,
 Though a bond-maiden, hath a free-born tongue.

 HYL. What word is spoken, mother? May I know?

 D�. That, with thy father lost to us so long,
 'Tis shame thou dost not learn his dwelling-place.

 HYL. Yea, I have learnt, if one may trust report.

 D�. Where art thou told his seat is fixed, my son?

 HYL. 'Tis said that through the length of this past year
 He wrought as bondman to a Lydian girl.

 D�. Hath he borne that? Then nothing can be strange!

 HYL. Well, that is over, I am told. He is free.

 D�. Where is he rumoured, then, alive or dead?

 HYL. In rich Euboea, besieging, as they tell,
 The town of Eurytus, or offering siege.

 D�. Child, hast thou heard what holy oracles
 He left with me, touching that very land?

 HYL. What were they, mother, for I never knew?

 D�. That either he must end his being there,
 Or, this one feat performed, his following time
 Should grace his life with fair prosperity.
 Wilt thou not then, my child, when he is held
 In such a crisis of uncertain peril,
 Run to his aid?--since we must perish with him,
 Or owe our lasting safety to his life.

 HYL. I will go, mother. Had I heard this voice
 Of prophecy, long since I had been there.
 Fear is unwonted for our father's lot.
 But now I know, my strength shall all be spent
 To learn the course of these affairs in full.

 D�. Go then, my son. Though late, to learn and do
 What wisdom bids, hath certainty of gain.
[Exit HYLLUS. D�ANIRA withdraws

 CHORUS (entering and turning towards the East).
 Born of the starry night in her undoing, I 1
 Lulled in her bosom at thy parting glow,
 O Sun! I bid thee show,
 What journey is Alcmena's child pursuing?
 What region holds him now,
 'Mong winding channels of the deep,
 Or Asian plains, or rugged Western steep?
 Declare it, thou
 Peerless in vision of thy flashing ray
 That lightens on the world with each new day.
 Sad D�anira, bride of battle-wooing[1],I 2
 Ne'er lets her tearful eyelids close in rest,
 But in love-longing breast,
 Like some lorn bird its desolation rueing,
 Of her great husband's way
 Still mindful, worn with harrowing fear
 Lest some new danger for him should be near,
 By night and day
 Pines on her widowed couch of ceaseless thought,
 With dread of evil destiny distraught: [Enter D�ANIRA.

 For many as are billows of the SouthII 1
 Blowing unweariedly, or Northern gale,
 One going and another coming on
 Incessantly, baffling the gazer's eye,
 Such Cretan ocean of unending toil
 Cradles our Cadmus-born, and swells his fame.
 But still some power doth his foot recall
 From stumbling down to Hades' darkling hall.

 Wherefore, in censure of thy mood, I bringII 2
 Glad, though opposing, counsel. Let not hope
 Grow weary. Never hath a painless life
 Been cast on mortals by the power supreme
 Of the All-disposer, Cronos' son. But joy
 And sorrow visit in perpetual round
 All mortals, even as circleth still on high
 The constellation of the Northern sky.

 What lasteth in the world? Not starry night, III
 Nor wealth, nor tribulation; but is gone
 All suddenly, while to another soul
 The joy or the privation passeth on.
 These hopes I bid thee also, O my Queen!
 Hold fast continually, for who hath seen
 Zeus so forgetful of his own?
 How can his providence forsake his son?

 D�. I see you have been told of my distress,
 And that hath brought you. But my inward woe,
 Be it evermore unknown to you, as now!
 Such the fair garden of untrammeled ease
 Where the young life grows safely. No fierce heat,
 No rain, no wind disturbs it, but unharmed
 It rises amid airs of peace and joy,
 Till maiden turn to matron, and the night
 Inherit her dark share of anxious thought,
 Haunted with fears for husband or for child.
 Then, imaged through her own calamity,
 Some one may guess the burden of my life.
 Full many have been the sorrows I have wept,
 But one above the rest I tell to-day.
 When my great husband parted last from home,
 He left within the house an ancient scroll
 Inscribed with characters of mystic note,
 Which Heracles had never heretofore,
 In former labours, cared to let me see,--
 As bound for bright achievement, not for death.
 But now, as though his life had end, he told
 What marriage-portion I must keep, what shares
 He left his sons out of their father's ground:
 And set a time, when fifteen moons were spent,
 Counted from his departure, that even then
 Or he must die, or if that date were out
 And he had run beyond it, he should live
 Thenceforth a painless and untroubled life.
 Such by Heaven's fiat was the promised end
 Of Heracles' long labours, as he said;
 So once the ancient oak-tree had proclaimed
 In high Dodona through the sacred Doves.
 Of which prediction on this present hour
 In destined order of accomplishment
 The veritable issue doth depend.
 And I, dear friends, while taking rest, will oft
 Start from sweet slumbers with a sudden fear,
 Scared by the thought, my life may be bereft
 Of the best husband in the world of men.

 CH. Hush! For I see approaching one in haste,
 Garlanded, as if laden with good news.

 Enter Messenger.

 MESSENGER. Queen D�anira, mine shall be the tongue
 To free thee first from fear. Alcmena's child
 Is living, be assured, and triumphing,
 And bringing to our Gods the fruits of war.

 D�. What mean'st thou, aged sir, by what thou sayest?

 MESS. That soon thy husband, envied all around,
 Will come, distinguished with victorious might.

 D�. What citizen or stranger told thee this?

 MESS. Your herald Lichas, where the oxen graze
 The summer meadow, cries this to a crowd.
 I, hearing, flew off hither, that being first
 To bring thee word thereof, I might be sure
 To win reward and gratitude from thee.

 D�. And how is he not here, if all be well?

 MESS. Crossed by no light impediment, my Queen.
 For all the Maliac people, gathering round,
 Throng him with question, that he cannot move.
 But he must still the travail of each soul,
 And none will be dismissed unsatisfied.
 Such willing audience he unwillingly
 Harangues, but soon himself will come in sight.

 D�. O Zeus! who rulest Oeta's virgin wold,
 At last, though late, thou hast vouchsafed us joy.
 Lift up your voices, O my women! ye
 Within the halls, and ye beyond the gate!
 For now we reap the gladness of a ray,
 That dawns unhoped for in this rumour's sound.

 CHORUS
 With a shout by the hearth let the palace roof ring
 From those that are dreaming of bridal, and ye,
 Young men, let your voices in harmony sing
 To the God of the quiver, the Lord of the free!
 And the Paean withal from the maiden band
 To Artemis, huntress of many a land,
 Let it rise o'er the glad roof tree,
 To Phoebus' own sister, with fire in each hand,
 And the Nymphs that her co-mates be!
 My spirit soars. O sovereign of my soul!
 I will accept the thrilling flute's control. [They dance
 The ivy-crown�d thyrsus, see!
 With Bacchic fire is kindling me,
 And turns my emulous tread
 Where'er the mazy dance may lead.
 Euo�! Euo�!
 O Paean! send us joy.
 See, dearest Queen, behold!
 Before thy gaze the event will now unfold.

 D�. Think not mine eye hath kept such careless guard,
 Dear maids, that I could miss this moving train.
 Herald, I bid thee hail, although so late
 Appearing, if thou bringest health with thee!

 Enter LICHAS, with Captive Women.

 LICHAS. A happy welcome on a happy way,
 As prosperous our achievement. Meet it is
 Good words should greet bright actions, mistress mine!

 D�. Kind friend, first tell me what I first would know--
 Shall I receive my Heracles alive?

 LICH. I left him certainly alive and strong:
 Blooming in health, not with disease oppressed.

 D�. In Greece, or in some barbarous country? Tell!

 LICH. Euboea's island hath a promontory,
 Where to Cenaean Zeus he consecrates
 Rich altars and the tribute of the ground.

 D�. Moved by an oracle, or from some vow?

 LICH. So vowed he when he conquered with the spear
 The country of these women whom you see.

 D�. And who, by Heaven, are they? Who was their sire?
 Their case is piteous, or eludes my thought.

 LICH. He took them for the service of the Gods
 And his own house, when high Oechalia fell.

 D�. Was't then before that city he was kept
 Those endless ages of uncounted time?

 LICH. Not so. The greater while he was detained
 Among the Lydians, sold, as he declares,
 To bondage. Nor be jealous of the word,
 Since Heaven, my Queen, was author of the deed.
 Enthrall�d so to Asian Omphal�,
 He, as himself avers, fulfilled his year.
 The felt reproach whereof so chafed his soul,
 He bound fierce curses on himself and sware
 That,--children, wife and all,--he yet would bring
 In captive chains the mover of this harm.
 Nor did this perish like an idle word,
 But, when the stain was off him, straight he drew
 Allied battalions to assault the town
 Of Eurytus, whom, sole of earthly powers,
 He had noted as the source of his annoy,
 Because, having received him in his hall
 A guest of ancient days, he burst on him
 With outrage of loud voice and villanous mind,
 Saying, 'with his hand upon the unerring bow,
 Oechalia's princes could o'ershoot his skill;
 And born to bondage, he must quail beneath
 His overlord'; lastly, to crown this cry,
 When at a banquet he was filled with wine,
 He flung him out of door. Whereat being wroth,
 When Iphitus to the Tirynthian height
 Followed the track where his brood-mares had strayed,
 He, while the thought and eye of the man by chance
 Were sundered, threw him from the tower-crowned cliff.
 In anger for which deed the Olympian King,
 Father of Gods and men, delivered him
 To be a bond-slave, nor could brook the offence,
 That of all lives he vanquished, this alone
 Should have been ta'en by guile. For had he wrought
 In open quittance of outrageous wrong,
 Even Zeus had granted that his cause was just.
 The braggart hath no favour even in Heaven.
 Whence they, o'erweening with their evil tongue,
 Are now all dwellers in the house of death,
 Their ancient city a captive;--but these women
 Whom thou beholdest, from their blest estate
 Brought suddenly to taste of piteous woe,
 Come to thy care. This task thy wedded lord
 Ordained, and I, his faithful minister,
 Seek to perform. But, for his noble self,
 When with pure hands he hath done sacrifice
 To his Great Father for the victory given,
 Look for his coming, lady. This last word
 Of all my happy speech is far most sweet.

 CH. Now surety of delight is thine, my Queen,
 Part by report and part before thine eye.

 D�. Yea, now I learn this triumph of my lord,
 Joy reigns without a rival in my breast.
 This needs must run with that in fellowship.
 Yet wise consideration even of good
 Is flecked with fear of what reverse may come.
 And I, dear friends, when I behold these maids,
 Am visited with sadness deep and strange.
 Poor friendless beings, in a foreign land
 Wandering forlorn in homeless orphanhood!
 Erewhile, free daughters of a freeborn race,
 Now, snared in strong captivity for life.
 O Zeus of battles, breaker of the war,
 Ne'er may I see thee[2] turn against my seed
 So cruelly; or, if thou meanest so,
 Let me be spared that sorrow by my death!
 Such fear in me the sight of these hath wrought.
 Who art thou, of all damsels most distressed?
 Single or child-bearing? Thy looks would say,
 A maid, of no mean lineage. Lichas, tell,
 Who is the stranger-nymph? Who gave her birth?
 Who was her sire? Mine eye hath pitied her
 O'er all, as she o'er all hath sense of woe.

 LICH. What know I? Why should'st thou demand? Perchance
 Not lowest in the list of souls there born.

 D�. How if a princess, offspring of their King?

 LICH. I cannot tell. I did not question far.

 D�. Have none of her companions breathed her name?

 LICH. I brought them silently. I did not hear.

 D�. Yet speak it to us of thyself, poor maid!
 'Tis sorrow not to know thee who thou art.

 LICH. She'll ne'er untie her tongue, if she maintain
 An even tenor, since nor more nor less
 Would she disclose; but, poor unfortunate!
 With agonizing sobs and tears she mourns
 This crushing sorrow, from the day she left
 Her wind-swept home. Her case is cruel, sure,--
 And claims a privilege from all who feel.

 D�. Well, let her go, and pass beneath the roof
 In peace, as she desires; nor let fresh pain
 From me be added to her previous woe.
 She hath enough already. Come, away!
 Let's all within at once, that thou mayest speed
 Thy journey, and I may order all things here.
 [Exit LICHAS, with Captives, into the house.
D�ANIRA is about to follow them

 Re-enter Messenger.

 MESS. Pause first there on the threshold, till you learn
 (Apart from those) who 'tis you take within,
 And more besides that you yet know not of,
 Which deeply imports your knowing. Of all this
 I throughly am informed.

 D�.What cause hast thou
 Thus to arrest my going?

 MESS.Stand, and hear.
 Not idle was my former speech, nor this.

 D�. Say, must we call them back in presence here,
 Or would'st thou tell thy news to these and me?

 MESS. To thee and these I may, but let those be.

 D�. Well, they are gone. Let words declare thy drift.

 MESS. That man, in all that he hath lately said,
 Hath sinned against the truth: or now he's false,
 Or else unfaithful in his first report.

 D�. What? Tell me thy full meaning clearly forth.
 That thou hast uttered is all mystery.

 MESS. I heard this herald say, while many thronged
 To hearken, that this maiden was the cause,
 Why lofty-towered Oechalia and her lord
 Fell before Heracles, whom Love alone
 Of heavenly powers had warmed to this emprise,
 And not the Lydian thraldom or the tasks
 Of rigorous Omphal�, nor that wild fate
 Of rock-thrown Iphitus. Now he thrusts aside
 The Love-god, contradicting his first tale.
 When he that was her sire could not be brought
 To yield the maid for Heracles to hold
 In love unrecognized, he framed erelong
 A feud about some trifle, and set forth
 In arms against this damsel's fatherland
 (Where Eurytus, the herald said, was king)
 And slew the chief her father; yea, and sacked
 Their city. Now returning, as you see,
 He sends her hither to his halls, no slave,
 Nor unregarded, lady,--dream not so!
 Since all his heart is kindled with desire.
 I, O my Queen! thought meet to show thee all
 The tale I chanced to gather from his mouth,
 Which many heard as well as I, i' the midst
 Of Trachis' market-place, and can confirm
 My witness. I am pained if my plain speech
 Sound harshly, but the honest truth I tell.

 D�. Ah me! Where am I? Whither am I fallen?
 What hidden woe have I unwarily
 Taken beneath my roof? O misery!
 Was she unknown, as he that brought her sware?

 MESS. Nay, most distinguished both in birth and mien;
 Called in her day of freedom Iol�,
 Eurytus' daughter,--of whose parentage,
 Forsooth as ignorant, he ne'er would speak.

 CH. I curse not all the wicked, but the man
 Whose secret practices deform his life.

 D�. Say, maidens, how must I proceed? The words
 Now spoken have bewildered all my mind.

 CH. Go in and question Lichas, who perchance
 Will tell the truth if you but tax him home.

 D�. I will; you counsel reasonably.

 MESS. And I,
 Shall I bide here till thou com'st forth? Or how?

 D�. Remain. For see, without my sending for him,
 He issueth from the palace of himself.

 Enter LICHAS.

 LICH. What message must I carry to my lord?
 Tell me, my Queen. I am going, as thou seest.

 D�. So slow in coming, and so quickly flown,
 Ere one have time to talk with thee anew!

 LICH. What wouldst thou ask me? I am bent to hear.

 D�. And art thou bent on truth in the reply?

 LICH. By Heaven! in all that I have knowledge of.

 D�. Then tell me, who is she thou brought'st with thee?

 LICH. An islander. I cannot trace her stock.

 MESS. Look hither, man. Who is't to whom thou speakest?

 LICH. Why such a question? What is thine intent?

 MESS. Nay, start not, but make answer if thou knowest.

 LICH. To D�anira, Oeneus' queenly child,
 Heracles' wife,--if these mine eyes be true,--
 My mistress.

 MESS.Ay, that is the very word
 I longed to hear thee speak. Thy mistress, sayest?

 LICH. To whom I am bound.

 MESS. Hold there! What punishment
 Wilt thou accept, if thou art found to be
 Faithless to her?

 LICH. I faithless! What dark speech
 Hast thou contrived?

 MESS.Not I at all. 'Tis thou
 Dost wrap thy thoughts i' the dark.

 LICH. Well, I will go.
 'Tis folly to have heard thee for so long.

 MESS. You go not till you answer one word more.

 LICH. One, or a thousand! You'll not stint, I see.

 MESS. Thou knowest the captive maid thou leddest home?

 LICH. I do. But wherefore ask?

 MESS.Did you not say
 That she, on whom you look with ignorant eye,
 Was Iol�, the daughter of the King,
 Committed to your charge?

 LICH. Where? Among whom?
 What witness of such words will bear thee out?

 MESS. Many and sound. A goodly company
 In Trachis' market-place heard thee speak this.

 LICH. Ay.
 I said 'twas rumoured. But I could not give
 My vague impression for advised report.

 MESS. Impression, quotha! Did you not on oath
 Proclaim your captive for your master's bride?

 LICH. My master's bride! Dear lady, by the Gods,
 Who is the stranger? for I know him not.

 MESS. One who was present where he heard thee tell,
 How that whole city was subdued and taken,
 Not for the bondage to the Lydian girl,
 But through the longing passion for this maid.

 LICH. Dear lady, let the fellow be removed.
 To prate with madmen is mere foolishness.

 D�. Nay, I entreat thee by His name, whose fire
 Lightens down Oeta's topmost glen, be not
 A niggard of the truth. Thou tell'st thy tale
 To no weak woman, but to one who knows
 Mankind are never constant to one joy.
 Whoso would buffet Love, aspires in vain.
 For Love leads even Immortals at his will,
 And me. Then how not others, like to me?
 'Twere madness, sure, in me to blame my lord
 When this hath caught him, or the woman there,
 His innocent accomplice in a thing,
 No shame to either, and no harm to me.
 It is not so. But if from him thou learnest
 The lore of falsehood, it were best unlearnt;
 Or if the instruction comes of thine own thought,
 Such would-be kindness doth not prove thee kind.
 Then tell me all the truth. To one free-born
 The name of liar is a hateful lot.
 And thou canst not be hid. Thy news was heard
 By many, who will tell me. If thou fearest,
 Thou hast no cause--for doubtfulness is pain,
 But to know all, what harm? His loves ere now
 Were they not manifold? And none hath borne
 Reproach or evil word from me. She shall not,
 Though his new passion were as strong as death;
 Since most mine eye hath pitied her, because
 Her beauty was the ruin of her life,
 And all unweeting, she her own bright land,
 Poor hapless one! hath ravaged and enslaved.--
 Let that be as it must. But for thy part,
 Though false to others, be still true to me.

 CH. 'Tis fairly said. Comply. Thou ne'er wilt blame
 Her faithfulness, and thou wilt earn our loves.

 LICH. Yea, dear my Queen, now I have seen thee hold
 Thy mortal wishes within mortal bound
 So meekly, I will freely tell thee all.
 It is as he avers. This maiden's love,
 Piercing through Heracles, was the sole cause,
 Why her Oechalia, land of plenteous woe,
 Was made the conquest of his spear. And he--
 For I dare so far clear him--never bade
 Concealment or denial. But myself,
 Fearing the word might wound thy queenly heart,
 Sinned, if thou count such tenderness a sin.
 But now that all is known, for both your sakes,
 His, and thine own no less, look favouringly
 Upon the woman, and confirm the word
 Thou here hast spoken in regard to her:--
 For he, whose might is in all else supreme,
 Is wholly overmastered by her love.

 D�. Yea, so my mind is bent. I will do so.
 I will not, in a bootless strife 'gainst Heaven,
 Augment my misery with self-sought ill.
 Come, go we in, that thou may'st bear from me
 Such message as is meet, and also carry
 Gifts, such as are befitting to return
 For gifts new-given. Thou ought'st not to depart
 Unladen, having brought so much with thee. [Exeunt

 CHORUS.
 Victorious in her might, I 1
 The Queen of soft delight
 Still ranges onward with triumphant sway.
 What she from Kronos' son
 And strong Poseidon won,
 And Pluto, King of Night, I durst not say.
 But who, to earn this bride,
 Came forth in sinewy pride
 To strive, or e'er the nuptial might be known
 With fearless heart I tell
 What heroes wrestled well,
 With showering blows, and dust in clouds upthrown.

 One was a river bold,I 2
 Horn-crowned, with tramp fourfold,
 Bull Achel��s, Acarnania's Fear;
 And one from Bacchus' town,
 Own son of Zeus, came down,
 With brandished mace, bent bow, and barb�d spear.
 Who then in battle brunt,
 Together, front to front,
 Hurled, eager both to win the beauteous prize;
 And Cypris 'mid the fray
 Alone, that dreadful day,
 Sate umpire, holding promise in her eyes.

 Then clashed the fist, then clanged the bow;II
 Then horns gave crashing blow for blow,
 Whilst, as they clung,
 The twining hip throw both essay
 And hurtling foreheads' fearful play,
 And groans from each were wrung.

 But the tender fair one far away
 Sate watching with an eye of piteous cheer
 (A mother's heart will heed the thing I say,)
 Till won by him who freed her from her fear.
 Sudden she leaves her mother's gentle side,
 Borne through the waste, our hero's tender bride.

 Enter D�ANIRA.

 D�. Dear friends, while yonder herald in the house
 Holds converse with the captives ere he go,
 I have stol'n forth to you, partly to tell
 The craft my hand hath compassed, and in part,
 To crave your pity for my wretchedness.
 For I have taken to my hearth a maid,--
 And yet, methinks, no maiden any more,
 Like some fond shipmaster, taking on board
 A cargo fraught with treason to my heart.
 And now we two are closed in one embrace
 Beneath one coverlet. Such generous meed
 For faith in guarding home this dreary while
 Hath the kind Heracles our trusty spouse,
 Sent in return! Yet, oft as he hath caught
 This same distemperature, I know not how
 To harbour indignation against him.
 But who that is a woman could endure
 To dwell with her, both married to one man?
 One bloom is still advancing, one doth fade.
 The budding flower is cropped, the full-blown head
 Is left to wither, while love passeth by
 Unheeding. Wherefore I am sore afraid
 He will be called my husband, but her mate,
 For she is younger. Yet no prudent wife
 Would take this angerly, as I have said.
 But, dear ones, I will tell you of a way,
 Whereof I have bethought me, to prevent
 This heart-break. I had hidden of long time
 In a bronze urn the ancient Centaur's gift,
 Which I, when a mere girl, culled from the wound
 Of hairy-breasted Nessus in his death.
 He o'er Evenus' rolling depths, for hire,
 Ferried wayfarers on his arm, not plying
 Or rowing-boat, or canvas-wing�d bark.
 Who, when with Heracles, a new-made bride,
 I followed by my father's sending forth,
 Shouldering me too, in the mid-stream, annoyed
 With wanton touch. And I cried out; and he,
 Zeus' son, turned suddenly, and from his bow
 Sent a wing'd shaft, that whizzed into his chest
 To the lungs. Then the weird Thing, with dying voice
 Spake to me:--'Child of aged Oene�s,
 Since thou wert my last burden, thou shalt win
 Some profit from mine act, if thou wilt do
 What now I bid thee. With a careful hand
 Collect and bear away the clotted gore
 That clogs my wound, e'en where the monster snake
 Had dyed the arrow with dark tinct of gall;
 And thou shalt have this as a charm of soul
 For Heracles, that never through the eye
 Shall he receive another love than thine.'
 Whereof bethinking me, for since his death
 I kept it in a closet locked with care,
 I have applied it to this robe, with such
 Addition as his living voice ordained.--
 The thing is done. No criminal attempts
 Could e'er be mine. Far be they from my thought,
 As I abhor the woman who conceives them!
 But if by any means through gentle spells
 And bonds on Heracles' affection, we
 May triumph o'er this maiden in his heart,
 My scheme is perfected. Unless you deem
 Mine action wild. If so, I will desist.

 CH. If any ground of confidence approve
 Thine act, we cannot check thy counsel here.

 D�. My confidence is grounded on belief,
 Though unconfirmed as yet by actual proof.

 CH. Well, do it and try. Assurance cannot come
 Till action bring experience after it.

 D�. The truth will soon be known. The man e'en now
 Is coming forth, and quickly will be there.
 Screen ye but well my counsel. Doubtful deeds,
 Wrapt close, will not deliver us to shame.

 Enter LICHAS.

 LICH. Daughter of Oeneus, tell me thy commands.
 Already time rebukes our tardiness.

 D�. Even that hath been my care, Lichas, while thou
 Wert talking to the stranger-maids within,
 That thou shouldst take for me this finewoven web,
 A present from these fingers to my lord.
 And when thou giv'st it, say that none of men
 Must wear it on his shoulders before him;
 And neither light of sun may look upon it,
 Nor holy temple-court, nor household flame,
 Till he in open station 'fore the Gods
 Display it on a day when bulls are slaughtered.
 So once I vowed, that should I ever see
 Or hear his safe return, I would enfold
 His glorious person in this robe, and show
 To all the Gods in doing sacrifice
 Him a fresh worshipper in fresh array.--
 The truth hereof he will with ease descry
 Betokened on this treasure-guarding seal.--
 Now go, and be advised, of this in chief,
 To act within thine office; then of this,
 To bear thee so, that from his thanks and mine
 Meeting in one, a twofold grace may spring.

 LICH. If this my Hermes-craft be firm and sure,
 Then never will I fail thee, O my Queen!
 But I will show the casket as it is
 To whom I bear it, and in faithfulness
 Add all the words thou sendest in fit place.

 D�. Go, then, at once. Thou hast full cognizance
 How things within the palace are preserved?

 LICH. I know, and will declare. There is no flaw.

 D�. Methinks thou knowest too, for thou hast seen,
 My kind reception of the stranger-maid?

 LICH. I saw, and was amazed with heart-struck joy.

 D�. What more is there to tell?--Too rash, I fear,
 Were thy report of longing on my part,
 Till we can learn if we be longed for there. [Exeunt severally

 CHORUS.
 O ye that haunt the strand I 1
 Where ships in quiet land
 Near Oeta's height and the warm rock-drawn well,
 And ye round Melis' inland gulf who dwell,
 Worshipping her who wields the golden wand,--
 (There Hellas' wisest meet in council strong):
 Soon shall the flute arise
 With sound of glad surprise,
 Thrilling your sense with no unwelcome song,
 But tones that to the harp of Heavenly Muse belong.

 Zeus' and Alcmena's son,-- I 2
 All deeds of glory done,--
 Speeds now triumphant to his home, whom we
 Twelve weary months of blind expectancy
 Lost in vast distance, from our country gone.
 While, sadly languishing, his loving wife,
 Still flowing down with tears,
 Pined with unnumbered fears.
 But Ares, lately stung to furious strife,
 Frees him for ever[3] from the toilsome life.

 O let him come to-day!II
 Ne'er may his vessel stay,
 But glide with feathery sweep of many an oar,
 Till from his altar by yon island shore
 Even to our town he wind his prosperous way,
 In mien returning mild,
 And inly reconciled,
 With that anointing in his heart ingrained,
 Which the dark Centaur's wizard lips ordained.

 Enter D�ANIRA.

 D�. O how I fear, my friends, lest all too far
 I have ventured in my action of to-day!

 CH. What ails thee, D�anira, Oeneus' child?

 D�. I know not, but am haunted by a dread,
 Lest quickly I be found to have performed
 A mighty mischief, through bright hopes betrayed.

 CH. Thou dost not mean thy gift to Heracles?

 D�. Indeed I do. Now I perceive how fond
 Is eagerness, where actions are obscure.

 CH. Tell, if it may be told, thy cause of fear.

 D�. A thing is come to pass, which should I tell,
 Will strike you with strange wonder when you learn.
 For, O my friends, the stuff wherewith I dressed
 That robe, a flock of soft and milkwhite wool,
 Is shrivelled out of sight, not gnawn by tooth
 Of any creature here, but, self-consumed,
 Frittered and wasting on the courtyard-stones.
 To let you know the circumstance at full,
 I will speak on. Of all the Centaur-Thing,
 When labouring in his side with the fell point
 O' the shaft, enjoined me, I had nothing lost,
 But his vaticination in my heart
 Remained indelible, as though engraved
 With pen of iron upon brass. 'Twas thus:--
 I was to keep this unguent closely hid
 In dark recesses, where no heat of fire
 Or warming ray might reach it, till with fresh
 Anointing I addressed it to an end.
 So I had done. And now this was to do,
 Within my chamber covertly I spread
 The ointment with piece of wool, a tuft
 Pulled from a home-bred sheep; and, as ye saw,
 I folded up my gift and packed it close
 In hollow casket from the glaring sun.
 But, entering in, a fact encounters me
 Past human wit to fathom with surmise.
 For, as it happened, I had tossed aside
 The bit of wool I worked with, carelessly,
 Into the open daylight, 'mid the blaze
 Of Helios' beam. And, as it kindled warm,
 It fell away to nothing, crumbled small,
 Like dust in severing wood by sawyers strewn.
 So, on the point of vanishing, it lay.
 But, from the place where it had lain, brake forth
 A frothy scum in clots of seething foam,
 Like the rich draught in purple vintage poured
 From Bacchus' vine upon the thirsty ground.
 And I, unhappy, know not toward what thought
 To turn me, but I see mine act is dire.
 For wherefore should the Centaur, for what end,
 Show kindness to the cause for whom he died?
 That cannot be. But seeking to destroy
 His slayer, he cajoled me. This I learn
 Too late, by sad experience, for no good.
 And, if I err not now, my hapless fate
 Is all alone to be his murderess.
 For, well I know, the shaft that made the wound
 Gave pain to Cheiron, who was more than man;
 And wheresoe'er it falls, it ravageth
 All the wild creatures of the world. And now
 This gory venom blackly spreading bane
 From Nessus' angry wound, must it not cause
 The death of Heracles? I think it must.
 Yet my resolve is firm, if aught harm him,
 My death shall follow in the self-same hour.
 She cannot bear to live in evil fame,
 Who cares to have a nature pure from ill.

 CH. Horrid mischance must needs occasion fear.
 But Hope is not condemned before the event.

 D�. In ill-advised proceeding not even Hope
 Remains to minister a cheerful mind.

 CH. Yet to have erred unwittingly abates
 The fire of wrath; and thou art in this case.

 D�. So speaks not he who hath a share of sin,
 But who is clear of all offence at home.

 CH. 'Twere well to say no more, unless thou hast aught
 To impart to thine own son: for he is here,
 Who went erewhile to find his father forth.

 HYLLUS (re-entering).
 O mother, mother!
 I would to heaven one of three things were true:
 Either that thou wert dead, or, living, wert
 No mother to me, or hadst gained a mind
 Furnished with better thoughts than thou hast now!

 D�. My son! what canst thou so mislike in me?

 HYL. I tell thee thou this day hast been the death
 Of him that was thy husband and my sire.

 D�. What word hath passed thy lips? my child, my child!

 HYL. A word that must be verified. For who
 Can make the accomplished fact as things undone?

 D�. Alas, my son! what saidst thou? Who hath told
 That I have wrought a deed so full of woe?

 HYL. 'Twas I myself that saw with these mine eyes
 My father's heavy state:--no hearsay word.

 D�. And where didst thou come near him and stand by?

 HYL. Art thou to hear it? On, then, with my tale!
 When after sacking Eurytus' great city
 He marched in triumph with first-fruits of war,--
 There is a headland, last of long Euboea,
 Surf-beat Cenaeum,--where to his father Zeus
 He dedicates high altars and a grove.
 There first I saw him, gladdened from desire.
 And when he now addressed him to the work
 Of various sacrifice, the herald Lichas
 Arrived from home, bearing thy fatal gift,
 The deadly robe: wherewith invested straight,
 As thou hadst given charge, he sacrificed
 The firstlings of the spoil, twelve bulls entire,
 Each after each. But the full count he brought
 Was a clear hundred of all kinds of head.
 Then the all-hapless one commenced his prayer
 In solemn gladness for the bright array.
 But presently, when from the holy things,
 And from the richness of the oak-tree core,
 There issued flame mingled with blood, a sweat
 Rose on his flesh, and close to every limb
 Clung, like stone-drapery from the craftsman's hand,
 The garment, glued unto his side. Then came
 The tearing pangs within his bones, and then
 The poison feasted like the venomed tooth
 Of murderous basilisk.--When this began,
 He shouted on poor Lichas, none to blame
 For thy sole crime, 'What guile is here, thou knave?
 What was thy fraud in fetching me this robe?'
 He, all-unknowing, in an evil hour
 Declared his message, that the gift was thine.
 Whereat the hero, while the shooting spasm
 Had fastened on the lungs, seized him by the foot
 Where the ankle turns i' the socket, and, with a thought,
 Hurl'd on a surf-vex'd reef that showed i' the sea:
 And rained the grey pulp from the hair, the brain
 Being scattered with the blood. Then the great throng
 Saddened their festival with piteous wail
 For one in death and one in agony.
 And none had courage to approach my sire,--
 Convulsed upon the ground, then tossed i' the air
 With horrid yells and crying, till the cliffs
 Echoed round, the mountain-promontories
 Of Locris, and Euboea's rugged shore.
 Wearied at length with flinging on the earth,
 And shrieking oft with lamentable cry,
 Cursing the fatal marriage with thyself
 The all-wretched, and the bond to Oeneus' house,
 That prize that was the poisoner of his peace,
 He lifted a wild glance above the smoke
 That hung around, and 'midst the crowd of men
 Saw me in tears, and looked on me and said,
 'O son, come near; fly not from my distress,
 Though thou shouldst be consum�d in my death,
 But lift and bear me forth; and, if thou mayest,
 Set me where no one of mankind shall see me.
 But if thy heart withhold thee, yet convey me
 Out of this land as quickly as ye may.
 Let me not die where I am now.' We then,
 Thus urgently commanded, laid him down
 Within our bark, and hardly to this shore
 Rowed him convulsed and roaring.--Presently,
 He will appear, alive or lately dead.
 Such, mother, is the crime thou hast devised
 And done against our sire, wherefore let Right
 And Vengeance punish thee!--May I pray so?
 I may: for thou absolv'st me by thy deed,
 Thou that hast slain the noblest of the Earth,
 Thy spouse, whose like thou ne'er wilt see again. [Exit D�ANIRA.

 CH. Why steal'st thou forth in silence? Know'st thou not
 Thy silence argues thine accuser's plea?

 HYL. Let her go off. Would that a sudden flood
 Might sweep her far and swiftly from mine eye!
 Why fondle vainly the fair-sounding name
 Of mother, when her acts are all unmotherly?
 Let her begone for me: and may she find
 Such joy as she hath rendered to my sire! [Exit HYLLUS

 CHORUS.
 See where falls the doom, of old I 1
 By the unerring Voice foretold,--
 'When twelve troublous years have rolled,
 Then shall end your long desire:
 Toil on toil no more shall tire
 The offspring of the Eternal Sire.'
 Lo! the destined Hour is come!
 Lo! it hath brought its burden home.
 For when the eyes have looked their last
 How should sore labour vex again?
 How, when the powers of will and thought are past,
 Should life be any more enthralled to pain?

 And if Nessus' withering shroud, I 2
 Wrought by destiny and craft,
 Steep him in a poisonous cloud.
 Steaming from the venomed shaft,
 Which to Death in hideous lair
 The many-wreathed Hydra bare,
 How shall he another day
 Feel the glad warmth of Helios' ray?--
 Enfolded by the Monster-Thing
 Of Lerna, while the cruel sting
 Of the shagg'd Centaur's murderous-guileful tongue
 Breaks forth withal to do him painful wrong.

 And she, poor innocent, who saw II 1
 Checkless advancing to the gate
 A mighty harm unto her state,--
 This rash young bridal without fear of law,--
 Gave not her will to aught that caused this woe,
 But since it came through that strange mind's conceiving,--
 That ruined her in meeting,--deeply grieving,
 She mourns with dewy tears in tenderest flow.
 The approaching hour appeareth great with woe:
 Some guile-born misery doth Fate foreshow.

 The springs of sorrow are unbound,II 2
 And such an agony disclose,
 As never from the hands of foes
 To afflict the life of Heracles was found.
 O dark with battle-stains, world-champion spear,
 That from Oechalia's highland leddest then
 This bride that followed swiftly in thy train,
 How fatally overshadowing was thy fear!
 But these wild sorrows all too clearly come
 From Love's dread minister[4], disguised and dumb.

 CH. 1.
 Am I a fool, or do I truly hear
 Lament new-rising from our master's home?
 Tell!

 CH. 2.
 Clearly from within a wailing voice
 Peals piteously. The house hath some fresh woe.

 CH. 3.
 Mark!
 How strangely, with what cloud upon her brow,
 Yon aged matron with her tidings moves!

 Enter Nurse.

 NURSE. Ah! mighty, O my daughters! was the grief
 Sprung from the gift to Heracles conveyed!

 LEADER OF CH. What new thing is befallen? Why speak'st thou so?

 NUR. Our Queen hath found her latest journey's end.
 Even now she is gone, without the help of feet.

 CH. Not dead?

 NUR.You know the whole.

 CH. Dead! hapless Queen!

 NUR. The truth hath twice been told.

 CH.O tell us how!
 What was her death, poor victim of dire woe?

 NUR. Most ruthless was the deed.

 CH.Say, woman, say!
 What was the sudden end?

 NUR. Herself she slew.

 CH. What rage, what madness, clutched
 The mischief-working brand?
 How could her single thought
 Contrive the accomplishment of death on death?

 NUR. Chill iron stopped the sources of her breath.

 CH. And thou, poor helpless crone, didst see this done?

 NUR. Yea, I stood near and saw.

 CH. How was it? Tell!

 NUR. With her own hand this violence was given.

 CH. What do I hear?

 NUR.The certainty of truth.

 CH. A child is come,
 From this new bridal that hath rushed within,
 A fresh-born Fury of woe!

 NUR. Too true. But hadst thou been at hand to see
 Her action, pity would have wrung thy soul.

 CH. Could this be ventured by a woman's hand?

 NUR. Ay, and in dreadful wise, as thou shalt hear.
 When all alone she had gone within the gate,
 And passing through the court beheld her boy
 Spreading the couch that should receive his sire,
 Ere he returned to meet him,--out of sight
 She hid herself, and fell at the altar's foot,
 And loudly cried that she was left forlorn;
 And, taking in her touch each household thing
 That formerly she used, poor lady, wept
 O'er all; and then went ranging through the rooms,
 Where, if there caught her eye the well-loved form
 Of any of her household, she would gaze
 And weep aloud, accusing her own fate
 And her abandoned lot, childless henceforth!
 When this was ended, suddenly I see her
 Fly to the hero's room of genial rest.
 With unsuspected gaze o'ershadowed near,
 I watched, and saw her casting on the bed
 The finest sheets of all. When that was done,
 She leapt upon the couch where they had lain
 And sat there in the midst. And the hot flood
 Burst from her eyes before she spake:--'Farewell,
 My bridal bed, for never more shalt thou
 Give me the comfort I have known thee give.'
 Then with tight fingers she undid her robe,
 Where the brooch lay before the breast, and bared
 All her left arm and side. I, with what speed
 Strength ministered, ran forth to tell her son
 The act she was preparing. But meanwhile,
 Ere we could come again, the fatal blow
 Fell, and we saw the wound. And he, her boy,
 Seeing, wept aloud. For now the hapless youth
 Knew that himself had done this in his wrath,
 Told all too late i' the house, how she had wrought
 Most innocently, from the Centaur's wit.
 So now the unhappy one, with passionate words
 And cries and wild embracings of the dead,
 Groaned forth that he had slain her with false breath
 Of evil accusation, and was left
 Orphaned of both, his mother and his sire.
 Such is the state within. What fool is he
 That counts one day, or two, or more to come?
 To-morrow is not, till the present day
 In fair prosperity have passed away. [Exit

 CHORUS.
 Which shall come first in my wail, I 1
 Which shall be last to prevail,
 Is a doubt that will never be done.

 Trouble at home may be seen, I 2
 Trouble is looked for with teen;
 And to have and to look for are one.

 Would some fair windII 1
 But waft me forth to roam
 Far from the native region of my home,
 Ere death me find, oppressed with wild affright
 Even at the sudden sight
 Of him, the valiant son of Zeus most High!
 Before the house, they tell, he fareth nigh,
 A wonder beyond thought,
 With torment unapproachable distraught.

 Hark! ... II 2
 The cause then of my cry
 Was coming all too nigh:
 (Doth the clear nightingale lament for nought?)
 Some step of stranger folk is this way brought.
 As for a friend they love
 Heavy and slow with noiseless feet they move.
 Which way? which way? Ah me! behold him come.
 His pallid lips are dumb.
 Dead, or at rest in sleep? What shall I say?
[HERACLES is brought in on a litter, accompanied
by HYLLUS and an Old Man

 HYL. Oh, woe is me!
 My father, piteous woe for thee!
 Oh, whither shall I turn my thought! Ah me!

 OLD M. Hush! speak not, O my child,
 Lest torment fierce and wild
 Rekindle in thy father's rugged breast,
 And break this rest
 Where now his life is held at point to fall.
 With firm lips clenched refrain thy voice through all.

 HYL. Yet tell me, doth he live,
 Old sir?

 OLD M. Wake not the slumberer,
 Nor kindle and revive
 The terrible recurrent power of pain,
 My son!

 HYL. My foolish words are done,
 But my full heart sinks 'neath the heavy strain.

 HERACLES. O Father, who are these?
 What countrymen? Where am I? What far land
 Holds me in pain that ceaseth not? Ah me!
 Again that pest is rending me. Pain, pain!

 OLD M. Now thou may'st know
 'Twas better to have lurked in silent shade
 And not thus widely throw
 The slumber from his eyelids and his head.

 HYL. I could not brook
 All speechless on his misery to look.

 MONODY.

 HER. O altar on the Euboean strand,
 High-heaped with offerings from my hand,
 What meed for lavish gifts bestowed
 From thy new sanctuary hath flowed!
 Father of Gods! thy cruel power
 Hath foiled me with an evil blight.
 Ah! would mine eyes had closed in night
 Ere madness in a fatal hour
 Had burst upon them with a blaze,
 No help or soothing once allays!

 What hand to heal, what voice to charm,
 Can e'er dispel this hideous harm?
 Whose skill save thine,
 Monarch Divine?
 Mine eyes, if such I saw,
 Would hail him from afar with trembling awe.
 Ah! ah!
 O vex me not, touch me not, leave me to rest,
 To sleep my last sleep on Earth's gentle breast.
 You touch me, you press me, you turn me again,
 You break me, you kill me! O pain! O pain!
 You have kindled the pang that had slumbered still.
 It comes, it hath seized me with tyrannous will!

 Where are ye, men, whom over Hellas wide
 This arm hath freed, and o'er the ocean-tide,
 And through rough brakes, from every monstrous thing?
 Yet now in mine affliction none will bring
 A sword to aid, a fire to quell this fire,
 O most unrighteous! nor to my desire
 Will come and quench the hateful life I hold
 With mortal stroke! Ah! is there none so bold?

 OLD M. Son of our hero, this hath mounted past
 My feeble force to cope with. Take him thou!
 Fresher thine eye and more the hope thou hast
 Than mine to save him.

 HYL. I support him now
 Thus with mine arm: but neither fleshly vest
 Nor inmost spirit can I lull to rest
 From torture. None may dream
 To wield this power, save he, the King supreme.

 HER. Son!
 Where art thou to lift me and hold me aright?
 It tears me, it kills me, it rushes in might,
 This cruel, devouring, unconquered pain
 Shoots forth to consume me. Again! again!
 O Fate! O Athena!--O son, at my word
 Have pity and slay me with merciful sword!

 Pity thy father, boy; with sharp relief
 Smite on my breast, and heal the wrathful grief
 Wherewith thy mother, God-abandoned wife,
 Hath wrought this ruin on her husband's life.
 O may I see her falling, even so
 As she hath thrown me, to like depth of woe!
 Sweet Hades, with swift death,
 Brother of Zeus, release my suffering breath!

 CH. Horror hath caught me as I hear this, woe,
 Racking our mighty one with mightier pain.

 HER. Many hot toils and hard beyond report,
 With sturdy thews and sinews I have borne,
 But no such labour hath the Thunderer's wife
 Or sour Eurystheus ever given, as this,
 Which Oeneus' daughter of the treacherous eye
 Hath fastened on my back, this amply-woven
 Net of the Furies, that is breaking me.
 For, glued unto my side, it hath devoured
 My flesh to the bone, and lodging in the lungs
 It drains the vital channels, and hath drunk
 The fresh life-blood, and ruins all my frame,
 Foiled in the tangle of a viewless bond.
 Yet me nor War-host, nor Earth's giant brood,
 Nor Centaur's monstrous violence could subdue,
 Nor Hellas, nor the Stranger, nor all lands
 Where I have gone, cleansing the world from harms.
 But a soft woman without manhood's strain
 Alone and weaponless hath conquered me.
 Son, let me know thee mine true-born, nor rate
 Thy mother's claim beyond thy sire's, but bring
 Thyself from out the chambers to my hand
 Her body that hath borne thee, that my heart
 May be assured, if lesser than my pain
 It will distress thee to behold her limbs
 With righteous torment agonized and torn.
 Nay, shrink not, son, but pity me, whom all
 May pity--me, who, like a tender girl,
 Am heard to weep aloud! This none could say
 He knew in me of old; for, murmuring not,
 I went with evil fortune, silent still.
 Now, such a foe hath found the woman in me!
 Ay, but come near; stand by me, and behold
 What cause I have for crying. Look but here!
 Here is the mystery unveiled. O see!
 Ye people, gaze on this poor quivering flesh,
 Look with compassion on my misery!
 Ah me!
 Ah! ah! Again!
 Even now the hot convulsion of disease
 Shoots through my side, and will not let me rest
 From this fierce exercise of wearing woe.
 Take me, O King of Night!
 O sudden thunderstroke.
 Smite me! O sire, transfix me with the dart
 Of thy swift lightning! Yet again that fang
 Is tearing; it hath blossomed forth anew,
 It soars up to the height!

O breast and back,
 O shrivelling arms and hands, ye are the same
 That crushed the dweller of the N�mean wild,
 The lion unapproachable and rude,
 The oxherd's plague, and Hydra of the lake
 Of Lerna, and the twi-form prancing throng
 Of Centaurs,--insolent, unsociable,
 Lawless, ungovernable:--the tusk�d pest
 Of Erymanthine glades; then underground
 Pluto's three-headed cur--a perilous fear,
 Born from the monster-worm; and, on the verge
 Of Earth, the dragon, guarding fruits of gold.
 These toils and others countless I have tried,
 And none hath triumphed o'er me. But to-day,
 Jointless and riven to tatters, I am wrecked
 Thus utterly by imperceptible woe;
 I, proudly named Alcmena's child, and His
 Who reigns in highest heaven, the King supreme!
 Ay, but even yet, I tell ye, even from here,
 Where I am nothingness and cannot move,
 She who hath done this deed shall feel my power.
 Let her come near, that, mastered by my might,
 She may have this to tell the world, that, dying,
 As living, I gave punishment to wrong.

 CH. O Hellas, how I grieve for thy distress!
 How thou wilt mourn in losing him we see!

 HYL. My father, since thy silence gives me leave,
 Still hear me patiently, though in thy pain!
 For my request is just. Lend me thy mind
 Less wrathfully distempered than 'tis now;
 Else thou canst never know, where thou art keen
 With vain resentment and with vain desire

 HER. Speak what thou wilt and cease, for I in pain
 Catch not the sense of thy mysterious talk

 HYL. I come to tell thee of my mother's case,
 And her involuntary unconscious fault.

 HER. Base villain! hast thou breathed thy mother's name,
 Thy father's murderess, in my hearing too!

 HYL. Her state requires not silence, but full speech.

 HER. Her faults in former time might well be told.

 HYL. So might her fault to day, couldst thou but know.

 HER. Speak, but beware base words disgrace thee not.

 HYL. List! She is dead even now with new-given wound.

 HER. By whom? Thy words flash wonder through my woe.

 HYL. Her own hand slaughtered her, no foreign stroke.

 HER. Wretch! to have reft this office from my hands.

 HYL. Even your rash spirit were softened, if you knew.

 HER. This bodes some knavery. But declare thy thought!

 HYL. She erred with good intent. The whole is said.

 HER. Good, O thou villain, to destroy thy sire!

 HYL. When she perceived that marriage in her home,
 She erred, supposing to enchain thy love.

 HER. Hath Trachis a magician of such might?

 HYL. Long since the Centaur Nessus moved her mind
 To work this charm for heightening thy desire.

 HER. O horror, thou art here! I am no more.
 My day is darkened, boy! Undone, undone!
 I see our plight too plainly. woe is me!
 Come, O my son! --thou hast no more a father,--
 Call to me all the brethren of thy blood,
 And poor Alcmena, wedded all in vain
 Unto the Highest, that ye may hear me tell
 With my last breath what prophecies I know.

 HYL. Thy mother is not here, but by the shore
 Of Tiryns hath obtained a dwelling-place;
 And of thy sons, some she hath with her there,
 And some inhabit Theb�'s citadel.
 But we who are with thee, sire, if there be aught
 That may by us be done, will hear, and do.

 HER. Then hearken thou unto this task, and show
 If worthily thou art reputed mine.
 Now is time to prove thee. My great father
 Forewarned me long ago that I should die
 By none who lived and breathed, but from the will
 Of one now dwelling in the house of death.
 And so this Centaur, as the voice Divine
 Then prophesied, in death hath slain me living.
 And in agreement with that ancient word
 I now interpret newer oracles
 Which I wrote down on going within the grove
 Of the hill-roving and earth-couching Selli,--
 Dictated to me by the mystic tongue
 Innumerous, of my Father's sacred tree;
 Declaring that my ever instant toils
 Should in the time that new hath being and life
 End and release me. And I look'd for joy.
 But the true meaning plainly was my death.--
 No labour is appointed for the dead.--
 Then, since all argues one event, my son,
 Once more thou must befriend me, and not wait
 For my voice goading thee, but of thyself
 Submit and second my resolve, and know
 Filial obedience for thy noblest rule.

 HYL. I will obey thee, father, though my heart
 Sinks heavily in approaching such a theme.

 HER. Before aught else, lay thy right hand in mine.

 HYL. Why so intent on this assurance, sire?

 HER. Give it at once and be not froward, boy.

 HYL. There is my hand: I will gainsay thee nought.

 HER. Swear by the head of him who gave me life.

 HYL. Tell me the oath, and I will utter it.

 HER. Swear thou wilt do the thing I bid thee do.

 HYL. I swear, and make Zeus witness of my troth.

 HER. But if you swerve, pray that the curse may come.

 HYL. It will not come for swerving:--but I pray.

 HER. Now, dost thou know on Oeta's topmost height
 The crag of Zeus?

 HYL.I know it, and full oft
 Have stood there sacrificing.

 HER.Then even there,
 With thine own hand uplifting this my body,
 Taking what friends thou wilt, and having lopped
 Much wood from the deep-rooted oak and rough
 Wild olive, lay me on the gathered pile,
 And burn all with the touch of pine-wood flame.
 Let not a tear of mourning dim thine eye;
 But silent, with dry gaze, if thou art mine,
 Perform it. Else my curse awaits thee still
 To weigh thee down when I am lost in night.

 HYL. How cruel, O my father, is thy tongue!

 HER. 'Tis peremptory. Else, if thou refuse,
 Be called another's and be no more mine.

 HYL. Alas that thou shouldst challenge me to this,
 To be thy murderer, guilty of thy blood!

 HER. Not I, in sooth: but healer of my pain,
 And sole preserver from a life of woe.

 HYL. How can it heal to burn thee on the pyre?

 HER. If this act frighten thee, perform the rest.

 HYL. Mine arms shall not refuse to carry thee.

 HER. And wilt thou gather the appointed wood?

 HYL. So my hand fire it not. In all but this,
 Not scanting labour, I will do my part.

 HER. Enough. 'Tis well. And having thus much given
 Add one small kindness to a list so full.

 HYL. How great soe'er it were, it should be done.

 HER. The maid of Eurytus thou knowest, I ween.

 HYL. Of Iol� thou speak'st, or I mistake.

 HER. Of her. This then is all I urge, my son.
 When I am dead, if thou wouldst show thy duty,
 Think of thine oath to me, and, on my word,
 Make her thy wife: nor let another man
 Take her, but only thou; since she hath lain
 So near this heart. Obey me, O my boy!
 And be thyself the maker of this bond.
 To spurn at trifles after great things given,
 Were to confound the meed already won.

 HYL. Oh, anger is not right, when men are ill!
 But who could bear to see thee in this mind?

 HER. You murmur, as you meant to disobey.

 HYL. How can I do it, when my mother's death
 And thy sad state sprang solely from this girl?
 Who, not possessed with furies, could choose this?
 Far better, father, for me too to die,
 Than to live still with my worst enemy.

 HER. This youth withdraws his reverence in my death.
 But, if thou yield'st not to thy father's best,
 The curse from Heaven shall dog thy footsteps still.

 HYL. Ah! thou wilt tell me that thy pain is come.

 HER. Yea, for thou wak'st the torment that had slept.

 HYL. Ay me! how cross and doubtful is my way!

 HER. Because you will reject your father's word.

 HYL. Must I be taught impiety from thee?

 HER. It is not impious to content my heart.

 HYL. Then you require this with an absolute will?

 HER. And bid Heaven witness to my strong command.

 HYL. Then I will do it, for the act is thine.
 I will not cast it off. Obeying thee,
 My sire, the Gods will ne'er reprove my deed.

 HER. Thou endest fairly. Now, then, O my son,
 Add the performance swiftly, that, before
 Some spasm or furious onset of my pain
 Have seized me, ye may place me on the pyre.
 Come, loiter not, but lift me. Now my end
 Is near, the last cessation of my woe.

 HYL. Since thy command is urgent, O my sire!
 We tarry not, but bear thee to the pyre.

 HER. Stubborn heart, ere yet again
 Wakes the fierce rebound of pain,
 While the evil holds aloof,
 Thou, with bit of diamond proof,
 Curb thy cry, with forc�d will
 Seeming to do gladly still!

 HYL. Lift him, men, and hate not me
 For the evil deeds ye see,
 Since the Heavens' relentless sway
 Recks not of the righteous way.
 He who gave life and doth claim
 From his seed a Father's name
 Can behold this hour of blame.
 Though the future none can tell,
 Yet the present is not well:
 Sore for him who bears the blow,
 Sad for us who feel his woe,
 Shameful to the Gods, we trow.

 CH. Maidens from the palace-hall,
 Come ye forth, too, at our call!
 Mighty deaths beyond belief,
 Many an unknown form of grief,
 Ye have seen to-day; and nought
 But the power of Zeus hath wrought.
