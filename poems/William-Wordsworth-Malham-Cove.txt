 Was the aim frustrated by force or guile,
 When giants scooped from out the rocky ground,
 Tier under tier, this semicirque profound?
 (Giants the same who built in Erin's isle
 That Causeway with incomparable toil!)
 Oh, had this vast theatric structure wound
 With finished sweep into a perfect round,
 No mightier work had gained the plausive smile
 Of all-beholding Phoebus! But, alas,
 Vain earth! false world! Foundations must be laid
 In Heaven; for, 'mid the wreck of IS and WAS,
 Things incomplete and purposes betrayed
 Make sadder transits o'er thought's optic glass
 Than noblest objects utterly decayed.
