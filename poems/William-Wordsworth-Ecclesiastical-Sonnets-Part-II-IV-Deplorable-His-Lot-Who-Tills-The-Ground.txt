title: Ecclesiastical Sonnets - Part II. - IV - Deplorable His Lot Who Tills The Ground
---

 Deplorable his lot who tills the ground,
 His whole life long tills it, with heartless toil
 Of villain-service, passing with the soil
 To each new Master, like a steer or hound,
 Or like a rooted tree, or stone earth-bound;
 But mark how gladly, through their own domains,
 The Monks relax or break these iron chains;
 While Mercy, uttering, through their voice, a sound
 Echoed in Heaven, cries out, "Ye Chiefs, abate
 These legalized oppressions! Man whose name
 And nature God disdained not; Man whose soul
 Christ died for, cannot forfeit his high claim
 To live and move exempt from all control
 Which fellow-feeling doth not mitigate!"
