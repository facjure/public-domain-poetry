All through the tepid Summer night
 The starless sky had poured a cool
Monotony of pleasant rain
 In music beautiful.

And for an hour I'd sat to watch
 Clouds moving on majestic feet,
Had heard down avenues of night
 Their hearts of thunder beat;

Saw ponderous limbs far-veined with gold
 Pulse fiery life o'er wood and plain,
While scattered, fell from monstrous palms
 The largess of the rain;

Beholding at each lightning's flash
 The generous silver on the sod,
In meek devotion bowed, I thanked
 These almoners of God.
