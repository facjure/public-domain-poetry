author: Alfred Lord Tennyson 
title: Poets And Critics
---

This thing, that thing is the rage,
Helter-skelter runs the age;
Minds on this round earth of ours
Vary like the leaves and flowers,
Fashion�d after certain laws;
Sing thou low or loud or sweet,
All at all points thou canst not meet,
Some will pass and some will pause.

What is true at last will tell:
Few at first will place thee well;
Some too low would have thee shine,
Some too high�no fault of thine�
Hold thine own, and work thy will!
Year will graze the heel of year,
But seldom comes the poet here,
And the Critic�s rarer still.
