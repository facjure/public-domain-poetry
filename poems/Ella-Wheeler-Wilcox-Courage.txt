title: Courage.

 There is a courage, a majestic thing
 That springs forth from the brow of pain, full-grown,
 Minerva-like, and dares all dangers known,
 And all the threatening future yet may bring;
 Crowned with the helmet of great suffering;
 Serene with that grand strength by martyrs shown,
 When at the stake they die and make no moan,
 And even as the flames leap up are heard to sing:

 A courage so sublime and unafraid,
 It wears its sorrows like a coat of mail;
 And Fate, the archer, passes by dismayed,
 Knowing his best barbed arrows needs must fail
 To pierce a soul so armored and arrayed
 That Death himself might look on it and quail.
