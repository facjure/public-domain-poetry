Scorn not the Sonnet; Critic, you have frown�d,
Mindless of its just honours; with this key
Shakespeare unlock�d his heart; the melody
Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch�s wound;
A thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound;
With it Cam�ens sooth�d an exile�s grief;
The Sonnet glitter�d a gay myrtle leaf
Amid the cypress with which Dante crown�d
His visionary brow: a glow-worm lamp,
It cheer�d mild Spenser, call�d from Faery-land
To struggle through dark ways; and when a damp
Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand
The Thing became a trumpet; whence he blew
Soul-animating strains, alas, too few!
