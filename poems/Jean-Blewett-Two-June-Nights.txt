A red rose in my lady's hair,
 A white rose in her fingers,
A wild bird singing low, somewhere,
 A song that pulses, lingers.
The sound of dancing and of mirth,
 The fiddle's merry chiming,
A smell of earth, of fresh, warm earth,
 And honeysuckle climbing;
My lady near, yet far away - 
 Ah, lonely June of yesterday!

A big white night of velvet sky,
 And Milky Way a-gleaming,
The fragrant blue smoke drifting by
 From camp-fire brightly beaming;
The stillness of the Northland far - 
 God's solitudes of splendor - 
My road a trail, my chart a star.
 Wind, 'mong the balsams slender,
Sing low: O glad June of to-day,
 My lady's near, though far away!
