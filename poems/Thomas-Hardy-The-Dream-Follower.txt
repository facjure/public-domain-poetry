A dream of mine flew over the mead
 To the halls where my old Love reigns;
And it drew me on to follow its lead:
 And I stood at her window-panes;

And I saw but a thing of flesh and bone
 Speeding on to its cleft in the clay;
And my dream was scared, and expired on a moan,
 And I whitely hastened away.
