	 Three wise men of Gotham
	 Went to sea in a bowl.
	 If the bowl had been stronger,
	 My song had been longer.

	Tres magi Gothamenses
	In scypho mare tranant
	Si cymba secura,
	Canenda sint plura.

	Cives tres docti Gothamenses �quora verrunt,
	 Crater et fragilis corpora obesa vehit.
	Mox en tempestas, surguntque ad sidera fluctus.
	 Musa dolens casum nunc memorare nequit.
