John Cornstalk lives in the Southern Land,
What says Cornstalk John?
Jack Cornstalk says in a loud firm voice:
�Land of the South, lead on.�

CHORUS:
 Land of the South, lead on, lead on,
Land of the South, lead on!
Land of the South, lead on, lead on,
Lead on, Land of the South!

John Bull lays claim to the Southern Land.
Jack, is the South Land thine?
John Cornstalk cries in a loud, firm voice:
�The Land of the South is mine!�

 Land of the South, lead on, lead on,
Land of the South, lead on!
Land of the South, lead on, lead on,
Lead on, Land of the South!

�By the long, long years my father toiled
In the pioneering band;
By the hardships of those early days,
I claim the Southern Land!�

 Land of the South, lead on, lead on,
Land of the South, lead on!
Land of the South, lead on, lead on,
Lead on, Land of the South!

But where shall the Land of the South lead to?
Where lead the nation�s van?
Jack Cornstalk cries from his strong young heart:
�To the Dynasty of Man.�

 Land of the South, lead on, lead on,
Land of the South, lead on!
Land of the South, lead on, lead on,
Lead on, Land of the South!
