title: And The Bairns Will Come
---

So you�ve seen at last what we have seen so long through scalding tears:
You have found what we, the People, we have known for twenty years:
And Australia�s hymn is swelling till the furthest fence-wires hum, 
Save your country, Legislators, and the bairns will come.

You would put the blame upon us, we are women, we are men;
And our fathers and our mothers gave the country nine and ten.
They had honest work and wages, and the ways to win a home, 
Give us half the chances they had, and the bairns will come.

Try the ranks of wealth and fashion, ask the rich and well-to-do,
With their nurseries and their nurses and their children one and two,
Will they help us bear the burden?, but their purse-proud lips are dumb.
Let us earn a decent living, and the bairns will come.

Young men, helpless in the city�s wheel of greed that never stops,
Tramp the streets for work while sweethearts slave in factories and shops.
Shall they marry and bear children to their parents� martyrdom?
Make the city what it should be, and the bairns will come.

Shall we give you sons and daughters to a life of never-rest,
Sacrificing all for nothing in the desert of the West,
To be driven to the city�s squalid suburb and the slum?
Make the city what it should be, and the bairns will come.

Don�t you hear Australia calling for her children unconceived?
Don�t you hear them calling to her while her heart is very grieved?
Give the best land to the farmers, make the barren West a home,
Save the rainfall, lock the rivers, and the bairns will come.
