title: The Spell Of The Rose

"I mean to build a hall anon,
 And shape two turrets there,
 And a broad newelled stair,
And a cool well for crystal water;
Yes; I will build a hall anon,
Plant roses love shall feed upon,
 And apple trees and pear."

He set to build the manor-hall,
 And shaped the turrets there,
 And the broad newelled stair,
And the cool well for crystal water;
He built for me that manor-hall,
And planted many trees withal,
 But no rose anywhere.

And as he planted never a rose
 That bears the flower of love,
 Though other flowers throve
A frost-wind moved our souls to sever
Since he had planted never a rose;
And misconceits raised horrid shows,
 And agonies came thereof.

"I'll mend these miseries," then said I,
 And so, at dead of night,
 I went and, screened from sight,
That nought should keep our souls in severance,
I set a rose-bush. "This," said I,
"May end divisions dire and wry,
 And long-drawn days of blight."

But I was called from earth yea, called
 Before my rose-bush grew;
 And would that now I knew
What feels he of the tree I planted,
And whether, after I was called
To be a ghost, he, as of old,
 Gave me his heart anew!

Perhaps now blooms that queen of trees
 I set but saw not grow,
 And he, beside its glow -
Eyes couched of the mis-vision that blurred me -
Ay, there beside that queen of trees
He sees me as I was, though sees
 Too late to tell me so!
