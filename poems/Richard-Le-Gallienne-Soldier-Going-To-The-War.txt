title: Soldier Going To The War

Soldier going to the war - 
Will you take my heart with you,
So that I may share a little
In the famous things you do?

Soldier going to the war - 
If in battle you must fall,
Will you, among all the faces,
See my face the last of all?

Soldier coming from the war - 
Who shall bind your sunburnt brow
With the laurel of the hero,
Soldier, soldier - vow for vow!

Soldier coming from the war - 
When the street is one wide sea,
Flags and streaming eyes and glory - 
Soldier, will you look for me?
