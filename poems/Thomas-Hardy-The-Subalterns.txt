 "I fain would lighten thee,
But there be laws in force on high
 Which say it must not be."

 The North, "knew I but how
To warm my breath, to slack my stride;
 But I am ruled as thou."

 Said Sickness. "Yet I swear
I bear thy little ark no spite,
 But am bid enter there."

 "I did not will a grave
Should end thy pilgrimage to-day,
 But I, too, am a slave!"

 And life to me wore less
That fell contour it wore ere when
 They owned their passiveness.
