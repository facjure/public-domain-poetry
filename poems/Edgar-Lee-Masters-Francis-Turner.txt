I could not run or play
In boyhood.
In manhood I could only sip the cup,
Not drink - For scarlet-fever left my heart diseased.
Yet I lie here
Soothed by a secret none but Mary knows:
There is a garden of acacia,
Catalpa trees, and arbors sweet with vines - 
There on that afternoon in June
By Mary's side - 
Kissing her with my soul upon my lips
It suddenly took flight.
