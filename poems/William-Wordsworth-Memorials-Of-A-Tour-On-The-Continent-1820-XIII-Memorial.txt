"Dem

Andenken

Meines Freundes

Aloys Reding

MDCCCXVIII."



 Around a wild and woody hill
 A gravelled pathway treading,
 We reached a votive Stone that bears
 The name of Aloys Reding.

 Well judged the Friend who placed it there
 For silence and protection;
 And haply with a finer care
 Of dutiful affection.

 The Sun regards it from the West;
 And, while in summer glory
 He sets, his sinking yields a type
 Of that pathetic story:

 And oft he tempts the patriot Swiss
 Amid the grove to linger;
 Till all is dim, save this bright Stone
 Touched by his golden finger.
