The Jung-Frau And The Fall Of The Rhine Near Schaffhausen,



 The Virgin Mountain, wearing like a Queen
 A brilliant crown of everlasting snow,
 Sheds ruin from her sides; and men below
 Wonder that aught of aspect so serene
 Can link with desolation. Smooth and green,
 And seeming, at a little distance, slow,
 The waters of the Rhine; but on they go
 Fretting and whitening, keener and more keen;
 Till madness seizes on the whole wide Flood,
 Turned to a fearful Thing whose nostrils breathe
 Blasts of tempestuous smoke, wherewith he tries
 To hide himself, but only magnifies;
 And doth in more conspicuous torment writhe,
 Deafening the region in his ireful mood.
