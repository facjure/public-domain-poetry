title: The Cry Of A Lost Soul
---

In that black forest, where, when day is done,
With a snake�s stillness glides the Amazon
Darkly from sunset to the rising sun,

A cry, as of the pained heart of the wood,
The long, despairing moan of solitude
And darkness and the absence of all good,

Startles the traveller, with a sound so drear,
So full of hopeless agony and fear,
His heart stands still and listens like his ear.

The guide, as if he heard a dead-bell toll,
Starts, drops his oar against the gunwale�s thole,
Crosses himself, and whispers, �A lost soul!�

�No, Se�or, not a bird. I know it well,
It is the pained soul of some infidel
Or cursed heretic that cries from hell.

�Poor fool! with hope still mocking his despair,
He wanders, shrieking on the midnight air
For human pity and for Christian prayer.

�Saints strike him dumb! Our Holy Mother hath
No prayer for him who, sinning unto death,
Burns always in the furnace of God�s wrath!�

Thus to the baptized pagan�s cruel lie,
Lending new horror to that mournful cry,
The voyager listens, making no reply.

Dim burns the boat-lamp: shadows deepen round,
From giant trees with snake-like creepers wound,
And the black water glides without a sound.

But in the traveller�s heart a secret sense
Of nature plastic to benign intents,
And an eternal good in Providence,

Lifts to the starry calm of heaven his eyes;
And lo! rebuking all earth�s ominous cries,
The Cross of pardon lights the tropic skies!

�Father of all!� he urges his strong plea,
�Thou lovest all: Thy erring child may be
Lost to himself, but never lost to Thee!

�All souls are Thine; the wings of morning bear
None from that Presence which is everywhere,
Nor hell itself can hide, for Thou art there.

�Through sins of sense, perversities of will,
Through doubt and pain, through guilt and shame and ill,
Thy pitying eye is on Thy creature still.

�Wilt thou not make, Eternal Source and Goal!
In Thy long years, life�s broken circle whole,
And change to praise the cry of a lost soul?�
