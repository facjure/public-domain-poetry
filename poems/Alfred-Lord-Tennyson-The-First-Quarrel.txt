I.
�Wait a little,� you say, �you are sure it �ll all come right,�
But the boy was born i� trouble, an� looks so wan an� so white:
Wait! an� once I ha� waited�I hadn�t to wait for long.
Now I wait, wait, wait for Harry.�No, no, you are doing me wrong!
Harry and I were married: the boy can hold up his head,
The boy was born in wedlock, but after my man was dead;
I ha� work�d for him fifteen years, an� I work an� I wait to the end.
I am all alone in the world, an� you are my only friend.

II.
Doctor, if you can wait, I�ll tell you the tale o� my life.
When Harry an� I were children, he call�d me his own little wife;
I was happy when I was with him, an� sorry when he was away.
An� when we play�d together, I loved him better than play;
He workt me the daisy chain�he made me the cowslip ball,
He fought the boys that were rude, an� I loved him better than all.
Passionate girl tho� I was, an� often at home in disgrace,
I never could quarrel with Harry�I had but to look in his face.

III.
There was a farmer in Dorset of Harry�s kin, that had need
Of a good stout lad at his farm; he sent, an� the father agreed;
So Harry was bound to the Dorsetshire farm for years an� for years;
I walked with him down to the quay, poor lad, an� we parted in tears.
The boat was beginning to move, we heard them a-ringing the bell,
I�ll never love any but you, God bless you, my own little Nell.�

IV.
I was a child, an� he was a child, an� he came to harm;
There was a girl, a hussy, that workt with him up at the farm,
One had deceived her an� left her alone with her sin an� her shame,
And so she was wicked with Harry; the girl was the most to blame.

V.
And years went over till I that was little had grown so tall,
The men would say of the maids, �Our Nelly�s the flower of �em all.�
I didn�t take heed o� them, but I taught myself all I could
To make a good wife for Harry, when Harry came home for good.

VI.
Often I seem�d unhappy, and often as happy too,
For I heard it abroad in the fields �I�ll never love any but you;�
�I�ll never love any but you� the morning song of the lark,
�I�11 never love any but you� the nightin gale�s hymn in the dark.

VII.
And Harry came home at last, but he look�d at me sidelong and shy,
Vext me a bit, till he told me that so many years had gone by,
I had grown so handsome and tall�that I might ha� forgot him somehow�
For he thought�there were other lads�he was fear�d to look at me now.

VIII.
Hard was the frost in the field, we were married o� Christmas day,
Married among the red berries, an� all as merry as May�
Those were the pleasant times, my house an� my man were my pride,
We seem�d like ships i� the Channel a-sailing with wind an� tide.

IX.
But work was scant in the Isle, tho� he tried the villages round,
So Harry went over the Solent to see if work could be found;
An� he wrote �I ha� six weeks� work, little wife, so far as I know;
I�ll come for an hour to-morrow, an� kiss you before I go.�

X.
So I set to righting the house, for wasn�t he coming that day?
An� I hit on an old deal-box that was pasted in a corner away,
It was full of old odds an� ends, an� a letter along wi� the rest,
I had better ha� put my naked hand in a hornets� nest.

XI.
�Sweetheart��this was the letter�this was the letter I read�
�You promised to find me work near you, an� I wish I was dead�
Didn�t you kiss me an� promise? you haven�t done it, my lad,
An� I almost died o� your going away, an� I wish that I had.�

XII.
I too wish that I had�in the pleasant times that had past,
Before I quarrell�d with Harry�my quarrel�the first an� the last.

XIII.
For Harry came in, an� I flung him the letter that drove me wild,
An� he told it me all at once, as simple as any child,
�What can it matter, my lass, what I did wi� my single life?
I ha� been as true to you as ever a man to his wife;
An� she wasn�t one o� the worst.� �Then,� I said, �I�m none o� the best.�
An� he smiled at me, �Ain�t you, my love? Come, come, little wife, let it rest!
The man isn�t like the woman, no need to make such a stir.�
But he anger�d me all the more, an� I said �You were keeping with her,
When I was a-loving you all along an� the same as before.�
An� he didn�t speak for a while, an� he anger�d me more and more.
�Then he patted my hand in his gentle way, �Let bygones be!�
�Bygones! you kept yours hush�d,� I said, �when you married me!
By-gones ma� be come-agains; an� she�in her shame an� her sin�
You�ll have her to nurse my child, if I die o� my lying in!
You�ll make her its second mother! I hate her�an� I hate you!�
Ah, Harry, my man, you had better ha� beaten me black an� blue
Than ha� spoken as kind as you did, when I were so crazy wi� spite,
�Wait a little, my lass, I am sure it �ill all come right.�

XIV.
An� he took three turns in the rain, an� I watch�d him, an� when he came in
I felt that my heart was hard, he was all wet thro� to the skin,
An� I never said �off wi� the wet,� I never said �on wi� the dry,�
So I knew my heart was hard, when he came to bid me goodbye.
�You said that you hated me, Ellen, but that isn�t true, you know;
I am going to leave you a bit�you�ll kiss me before I go?�

XV.
�Going! you�re going to her�kiss her�if you will,� I said�
I was near my time wi� the boy, I must ha� been light i� my head�
�I had sooner be cursed than kiss�d!��I didn�t know well what I meant,
But I turn�d my face from him, an� he turn�d his face an� he went.

XV1.
And then he sent me a letter, �I�ve gotten my work to do;
You wouldn�t kiss me, my lass, an� I never loved any but you;
I am sorry for all the quarrel an� sorry for what she wrote,
I ha� six weeks� work in Jersey an� go to-night by the boat.�

XVII.
An� the wind began to rise, an� I thought of him out at sea,
An� I felt I had been to blame; he was always kind to me.
�Wait a little, my lass, I am sure it �ill all come right��
An� the boat went down that night�the boat went down that night.
