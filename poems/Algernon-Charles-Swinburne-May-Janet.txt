(BRETON.)


�Stand up, stand up, thou May Janet,
And go to the wars with me.�
He�s drawn her by both hands
With her face against the sea.

�He that strews red shall gather white,
He that sows white reap red,
Before your face and my daughter�s
Meet in a marriage-bed.

�Gold coin shall grow in the yellow field,
Green corn in the green sea-water,
And red fruit grow of the rose�s red,
Ere your fruit grow in her.�

�But I shall have her by land,� he said,
�Or I shall have her by sea,
Or I shall have her by strong treason
And no grace go with me.�

Her father�s drawn her by both hands,
He�s rent her gown from her,
He�s ta�en the smock round her body,
Cast in the sea-water.

The captain�s drawn her by both sides
Out of the fair green sea;
�Stand up, stand up, thou May Janet,
And come to the war with me.�

The first town they came to
There was a blue bride-chamber;
He clothed her on with silk
And belted her with amber.

The second town they came to
The bridesmen feasted knee to knee;
He clothed her on with silver,
A stately thing to see.

The third town they came to
The bridesmaids all had gowns of gold;
He clothed her on with purple,
A rich thing to behold.

The last town they came to
He clothed her white and red,
With a green flag either side of her
And a gold flag overhead.
