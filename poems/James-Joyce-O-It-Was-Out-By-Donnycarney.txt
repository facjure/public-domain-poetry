title: O, It Was Out By Donnycarney
---

O, it was out by Donnycarney
When the bat flew from tree to tree
My love and I did walk together;
And sweet were the words she said to me.

Along with us the summer wind
Went murmuring, O, happily!
But softer than the breath of summer
Was the kiss she gave to me.
