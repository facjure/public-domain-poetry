title: Composed In Roslin Chapel During A Storm
---

 The wind is now thy organist; a clank
 (We know not whence) ministers for a bell
 To mark some change of service. As the swell
 Of music reached its height, and even when sank
 The notes, in prelude, Roslin! to a blank
 Of silence, how it thrilled thy sumptuous roof,
 Pillars, and arches, not in vain time-proof,
 Though Christian rites be wanting! From what bank
 Came those live herbs? by what hand were they sown
 Where dew falls not, where rain-drops seem unknown?
 Yet in the Temple they a friendly niche
 Share with their sculptured fellows, that, green-grown,
 Copy their beauty more and more, and preach,
 Though mute, of all things blending into one.
