title: Home-Thoughts, From The Sea

Nobly, nobly Cape Saint Vincent to the North-west died away;
Sunset ran, one glorious blood-red, reeking into Cadiz Bay;
Bluish mid the burning water, full in face Trafalgar lay;
In the dimmest North-east distance dawned Gibraltar grand and gray;
�Here and here did England help me: how can I help England?� say,
Whoso turns as I, this evening, turn to God to praise and pray,
While Jove�s planet rises yonder, silent over Africa.
