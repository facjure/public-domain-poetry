title: Be Angry Now No More
---

 Be angry now no more!
 If I have grieved thee - if
 Thy kindness, mine before,
 No hope may now restore:
 Only forgive, forgive!

 If still resentment burns
 In thy cold breast, oh if
 No more to pity turns,
 No more, once tender, yearns
 Thy love; oh yet forgive!...

 Ask of the winter rain
 June's withered rose again:
 Ask grace of the salt sea:
 She will not answer thee.
 God would ten times have shriven
 A heart so riven;
 In her cold care thou'dst be
 Still unforgiven.
