title: Change Should Breed Change

New doth the sun appear,
The mountains� snows decay,
Crown�d with frail flowers forth comes the baby year.
My soul, time posts away;
And thou yet in that frost
Which flower and fruit hath lost,
As if all here immortal were, dost stay.
For shame! thy powers awake,
Look to that Heaven which never night makes black,
And there at that immortal sun�s bright rays,
Deck thee with flowers which fear not rage of days!
