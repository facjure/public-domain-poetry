title: Filial Piety - On The Wayside Between Preston And Liverpool
---

 Untouched through all severity of cold;
 Inviolate, whate'er the cottage hearth
 Might need for comfort, or for festal mirth;
 That Pile of Turf is half a century old:
 Yes, Traveler! fifty winters have been told
 Since suddenly the dart of death went forth
 'Gainst him who raised it, his last work on earth:
 Thence has it, with the Son, so strong a hold
 Upon his Father's memory, that his hands,
 Through reverence, touch it only to repair
 Its waste. Though crumbling with each breath of air,
 In annual renovation thus it stands
 Rude Mausoleum! but wrens nestle there,
 And red-breasts warble when sweet sounds are rare.
