If they missed my face in Farmers� Arms
When the landlord lit the lamp,
They would grin and say in their country way,
�Oh! he�s down at the Gipsy camp!�
But they�d read of things in the Daily Mail
That the wild Australians do,
And I cared no day what the world might say,
For I came of the Gipsies too.
�Oh! the Gipsy crowd are a mongrel lot,
�And a thieving lot and sly!�
But I�d dined on fowls in the far-off south,
And a mongrel lot was I.
�Oh! the Gipsy crowd are a roving gang,
�And a sulky, silent crew!�
But they managed a smile and a word for me,
For I came of the Gipsies too.

And the old queen looked in my palm one day, 
And a shrewd old dame was she:
�My pretty young gent, you may say your say,
�You may laugh your laugh at me;
�But I�ll tell you the tale of your dead, dead past!�
And she told me all too true;
And she said that I�d die in a camp at last,
For I came of the Gipsies too.

And the young queen looked in my eyes that night,
In a nook where the hedge grew tall,
And the sky was swept and the stars were bright,
But her eyes had the sheen of all.
The spring was there, and the fields were fair,
And the world to my heart seemed new.
�Twas �A Romany lass to a Romany lad!�
But I came of the Gipsies too.

Now a Summer and Winter have gone between
And wide, wild oceans flow;
And they camp again by the sad old Thames,
Where the blackberry hedges grow.
�Twas a roving star on a land afar
That proved to a maid untrue,
But we�ll meet when they gather the Gipsy souls,
For I came of the Gipsies too.
