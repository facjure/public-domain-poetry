 Who, now, put dreams into thy slumbering mind?
 Who, with bright Fear's lean taper, crossed a hand
 Athwart its beam, and stooping, truth maligned,
 Spake so thy spirit speech should understand,
 And with a dread "He's dead!" awaked a peal
 Of frenzied bells along the vacant ways
 Of thy poor earthly heart; waked thee to steal,
 Like dawn distraught upon unhappy days,
 To prove nought, nothing? Was it Time's large voice
 Out of the inscrutable future whispered so?
 Or but the horror of a little noise
 Earth wakes at dead of night? Or does Love know
 When his sweet wings weary and droop, and even
 In sleep cries audibly a shrill remorse?
 Or, haply, was it I who out of dream
 Stole but a little where shadows course,
 Called back to thee across the eternal stream?
