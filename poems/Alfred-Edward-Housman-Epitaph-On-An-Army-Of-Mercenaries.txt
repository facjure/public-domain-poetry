title: Epitaph On An Army Of Mercenaries
---

These, in the day when heaven was falling,
The hour when earth�s foundations fled,
Followed their mercenary calling
And took their wages and are dead.

Their shoulders held the sky suspended;
They stood, and earth�s foundations stay;
What God abandoned, these defended,
And saved the sum of things for pay.
