�Where shall we dwell?� say you.
Wandering winds reply:
�In a temple with roof of blue
Under the splendid sky.�

Never a nobler home
We�ll find though an age we try
Than is arched by the azure dome
Of the all-enfolding sky.

Here we are wed, and here
We live under God�s own eye.
�Where shall we dwell,� my dear?
Under the splendid sky.
