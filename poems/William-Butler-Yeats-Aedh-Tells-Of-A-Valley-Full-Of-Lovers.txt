title: Aedh Tells Of A Valley Full Of Lovers
---

I dreamed that I stood in a valley, and amid sighs,
For happy lovers passed two by two where I stood;
And I dreamed my lost love came stealthily out of the wood
With her cloud-pale eyelids falling on dream-dimmed eyes:
I cried in my dream �O women bid the young men lay
�Their heads on your knees, and drown their eyes with your hair,
�Or remembering hers they will find no other face fair
�Till all the valleys of the world have been withered away.�
