 Methinks 'twere no unprecedented feat
 Should some benignant Minister of air
 Lift, and encircle with a cloudy chair,
 The One for whom my heart shall ever beat
 With tenderest love; or, if a safer seat
 Atween his downy wings be furnished, there
 Would lodge her, and the cherished burden bear
 O'er hill and valley to this dim retreat!
 Rough ways my steps have trod; too rough and long
 For her companionship; here dwells soft ease:
 With sweets that she partakes not some distaste
 Mingles, and lurking consciousness of wrong;
 Languish the flowers; the waters seem to waste
 Their vocal charm; their sparklings cease to please.
