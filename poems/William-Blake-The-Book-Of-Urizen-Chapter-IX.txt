1.

Then the Inhabitants of those Cities:
Felt their Nerves change into Marrow
And hardening Bones began
In swift diseases and torments,
In throbbings &amp; shootings &amp; grindings
Thro' all the coasts; till weaken'd
The Senses inward rush'd shrinking,
Beneath the dark net of infection.

2.

Till the shrunken eyes clouded over
Discernd not the woven hipocrisy
But the streaky slime in their heavens
Brought together by narrowing perceptions
Appeard transparent air; for their eyes
Grew small like the eyes of a man
And in reptile forms shrinking together
Of seven feet stature they remaind

3.

Six days they shrunk up from existence
And on the seventh day they rested
And they bless'd the seventh day, in sick hope:
And forgot their eternal life

4.

And their thirty cities divided
In form of a human heart
No more could they rise at will
In the infinite void, but bound down
To earth by their narrowing perceptions
They lived a period of years
Then left a noisom body
To the jaws of devouring darkness

5.

And their children wept, &amp; built
Tombs in the desolate places,
And form'd laws of prudence, and call'd them
The eternal laws of God

6.

And the thirty cities remaind
Surrounded by salt floods, now call'd
Africa: its name was then Egypt.

7.

The remaining sons of Urizen
Beheld their brethren shrink together
Beneath the Net of Urizen;
Perswasion was in vain;
For the ears of the inhabitants,
Were wither'd, &amp; deafen'd, &amp; cold:
And their eyes could not discern,
Their brethren of other cities.

8.

So Fuzon call'd all together
The remaining children of Urizen:
And they left the pendulous earth:
They called it Egypt, &amp; left it.

9.

And the salt ocean rolled englob'd.
