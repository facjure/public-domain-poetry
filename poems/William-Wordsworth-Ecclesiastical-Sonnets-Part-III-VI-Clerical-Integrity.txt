title: Ecclesiastical Sonnets - Part III. - VI - Clerical Integrity
---

 Nor shall the eternal roll of praise reject
 Those Unconforming; whom one rigorous day
 Drives from their Cures, a voluntary prey
 To poverty, and grief, and disrespect.
 And some to want, as if by tempests wrecked
 On a wild coast how destitute! did They
 Feel not that Conscience never can betray,
 That peace of mind is Virtue's sure effect.
 Their altars they forego, their homes they quit,
 Fields which they love, and paths they daily trod,
 And cast the future upon Providence;
 As men the dictate of whose inward sense
 Outweighs the world; whom self-deceiving wit
 Lures not from what they deem the cause of God.
