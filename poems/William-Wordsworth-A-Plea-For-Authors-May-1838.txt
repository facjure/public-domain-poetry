title: A Plea For Authors, May 1838

 Failing impartial measure to dispense
 To every suitor, Equity is lame;
 And social Justice, stript of reverence
 For natural rights, a mockery and a shame;
 Law but a servile dupe of false pretense,
 If, guarding grossest things from common claim
 Now and for ever, She, to works that came
 From mind and spirit, grudge a short-lived fence.
 "What! lengthened privilege, a lineal tie,
 For 'Books'!" Yes, heartless Ones, or be it proved
 That 'tis a fault in Us to have lived and loved
 Like others, with like temporal hopes to die;
 No public harm that Genius from her course
 Be turned; and streams of truth dried up, even at their source!
