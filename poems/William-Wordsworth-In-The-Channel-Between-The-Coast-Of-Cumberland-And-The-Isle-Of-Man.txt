title: In The Channel, Between The Coast Of Cumberland And The Isle Of Man

 Ranging the heights of Scawfell or Blackcomb,
 In his lone course the Shepherd oft will pause,
 And strive to fathom the mysterious laws
 By which the clouds, arrayed in light or gloom,
 On Mona settle, and the shapes assume
 Of all her peaks and ridges. What he draws
 From sense, faith, reason, fancy, of the cause,
 He will take with him to the silent tomb.
 Or, by his fire, a child upon his knee,
 Haply the untaught Philosopher may speak
 Of the strange sight, nor hide his theory
 That satisfies the simple and the meek,
 Blest in their pious ignorance, though weak
 To cope with Sages undevoutly free.
