---

 Sad thoughts, avaunt! partake we their blithe cheer
 Who gathered in betimes the unshorn flock
 To wash the fleece, where haply bands of rock,
 Checking the stream, make a pool smooth and clear
 As this we look on. Distant Mountains hear,
 Hear and repeat, the turmoil that unites
 Clamour of boys with innocent despites
 Of barking dogs, and bleatings from strange fear.
 And what if Duddon's spotless flood receive
 Unwelcome mixtures as the uncouth noise
 Thickens, the pastoral River will forgive
 Such wrong; nor need 'we' blame the licensed joys,
 Though false to Nature's quiet equipoise:
 Frank are the sports, the stains are fugitive.
