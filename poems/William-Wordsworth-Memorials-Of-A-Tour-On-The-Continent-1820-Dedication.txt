 Dear Fellow-travellers! think not that the Muse,
 To You presenting these memorial Lays,
 Can hope the general eye thereon would gaze,
 As on a mirror that gives back the hues
 Of living Nature; no, though free to choose
 The greenest bowers, the most inviting ways,
 The fairest landscapes and the brightest days,
 Her skill she tried with less ambitious views.
 For You she wrought: Ye only can supply
 The life, the truth, the beauty: she confides
 In that enjoyment which with You abides,
 Trusts to your love and vivid memory;
 Thus far contented, that for You her verse
 Shall lack not power the "meeting soul to pierce!"
W. WORDSWORTH.
RYDAL MOUNT, Nov. 1821.
