 Did pangs of grief for lenient time too keen,
 Grief that devouring waves had caused, or guilt
 Which they had witnessed, sway the man who built
 This Homestead, placed where nothing could be seen,
 Nought heard, of ocean troubled or serene?
 A tired Ship-soldier on paternal land,
 That o'er the channel holds august command,
 The dwelling raised, a veteran Marine.
 He, in disgust, turned from the neighbouring sea
 To shun the memory of a listless life
 That hung between two callings. May no strife
 More hurtful here beset him, doomed though free,
 Self-doomed, to worse inaction, till his eye
 Shrink from the daily sight of earth and sky!
