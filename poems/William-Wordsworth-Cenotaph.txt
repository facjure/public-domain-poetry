 By vain affections unenthralled,
 Though resolute when duty called
 To meet the world's broad eye,
 Pure as the holiest cloistered nun
 That ever feared the tempting sun,
 Did Fermor live and die.
 This Tablet, hallowed by her name,
 One heart-relieving tear may claim;
 But if the pensive gloom
 Of fond regret be still thy choice,
 Exalt thy spirit, hear the voice
 Of Jesus from her tomb!

 "I Am The Way, The Truth, And The Life"
