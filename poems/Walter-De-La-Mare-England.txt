 No lovelier hills than thine have laid
My tired thoughts to rest:
 No peace of lovelier valleys made
Like peace within my breast.

 Thine are the woods whereto my soul,
Out of the noontide beam,
 Flees for a refuge green and cool
And tranquil as a dream.

 Thy breaking seas like trumpets peal;
Thy clouds - how oft have I
 Watched their bright towers of silence steal
Into infinity!

 My heart within me faults to roam
In thought even far from thee:
 Thine be the grave whereto I come,
And thine my darkness be.
