title: Dedicatory Poem to the Princess Alice
---

Dead Princess, living Power, if that which lived
True life live on�and if the fatal kiss,
Born of true life and love, divorce thee not
From earthly love and life�if what we call
The spirit flash not all at once from out
This shadow into Substance�then perhaps
The mellow�d murmur of the people�s praise
From thine own State, and all our breadth of realm,
Where Love and Longing dress thy deeds in light,
Ascends to thee; and this March morn that sees
Thy Soldier-brother�s bridal orange-bloom
Break thro� the yews and cypress of thy grave,
And thine Imperial mother smile again,
May send one ray to thee! and who can tell�
Thou�England�s England-loving daughter�thou
Dying so English thou wouldst have her flag
Borne on thy coffin�where is he can swear
But that some broken gleam from our poor earth
May touch thee, while, remembering thee, I lay
At thy pale feet this ballad of the deeds
Of England, and her banner in the East?
