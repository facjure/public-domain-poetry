 Lance, shield, and sword relinquished, at his side
 A bead-roll, in his hand a clasped book,
 Or staff more harmless than a shepherd's crook,
 The war-worn Chieftain quits the world to hide
 His thin autumnal locks where Monks abide
 In cloistered privacy. But not to dwell
 In soft repose he comes: within his cell,
 Round the decaying trunk of human pride,
 At morn, and eve, and midnight's silent hour,
 Do penitential cogitations cling;
 Like ivy, round some ancient elm, they twine
 In grisly folds and strictures serpentine;
 Yet, while they strangle, a fair growth they bring,
 For recompense, their own perennial bower.
