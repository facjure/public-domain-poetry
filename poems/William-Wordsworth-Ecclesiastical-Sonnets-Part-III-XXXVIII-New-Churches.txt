 But liberty, and triumphs on the Main,
 And laureled armies, not to be withstood
 What serve they? if, on transitory good
 Intent, and sedulous of abject gain,
 The State (ah, surely not preserved in vain!)
 Forbear to shape due channels which the Flood
 Of sacred truth may enter, till it brood
 O'er the wide realm, as o'er the Egyptian plain
 The all-sustaining Nile. No more, the time
 Is conscious of her want; through England's bounds,
 In rival haste, the wished-for Temples rise!
 I hear their sabbath bells' harmonious chime
 Float on the breeze, the heavenliest of all sounds
 That vale or hill prolongs or multiplies!
