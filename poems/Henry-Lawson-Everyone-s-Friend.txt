�Nobody's enemy save his own�,
(What shall it be in the end?),
Still by the nick-name he is known,
�Everyone�s Friend.�
�Nobody�s Enemy� stands alone
While he has money to lend,
�Nobody�s Enemy� holds his own,
�Everyone�s Friend�

�Nobody�s Enemy� down and out,
Game to the end,
And he mostly dies with no one about,
�Everyone�s Friend.�
