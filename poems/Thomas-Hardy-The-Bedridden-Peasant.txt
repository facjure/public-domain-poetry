To An Unknowing God



Much wonder I - here long low-laid -
 That this dead wall should be
Betwixt the Maker and the made,
 Between Thyself and me!

For, say one puts a child to nurse,
 He eyes it now and then
To know if better 'tis, or worse,
 And if it mourn, and when.

But Thou, Lord, giv'st us men our clay
 In helpless bondage thus
To Time and Chance, and seem'st straightway
 To think no more of us!

That some disaster cleft Thy scheme
 And tore us wide apart,
So that no cry can cross, I deem;
 For Thou art mild of heart,

And would'st not shape and shut us in
 Where voice can not he heard:
'Tis plain Thou meant'st that we should win
 Thy succour by a word.

Might but Thy sense flash down the skies
 Like man's from clime to clime,
Thou would'st not let me agonize
 Through my remaining time;

But, seeing how much Thy creatures bear -
 Lame, starved, or maimed, or blind -
Thou'dst heal the ills with quickest care
 Of me and all my kind.

Then, since Thou mak'st not these things be,
 But these things dost not know,
I'll praise Thee as were shown to me
 The mercies Thou would'st show!
