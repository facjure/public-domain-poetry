title: The River Duddon - A Series Of Sonnets, 1820. - XXVII - Fallen, And Diffused Into A Shapeless Heap
---

 Fallen, and diffused into a shapeless heap,
 Or quietly self-buried in earth's mould,
 Is that embattled House, whose massy Keep,
 Flung from yon cliff a shadow large and cold.
 There dwelt the gay, the bountiful, the bold;
 Till nightly lamentations, like the sweep
 Of winds, though winds were silent, struck a deep
 And lasting terror through that ancient Hold.
 Its line of Warriors fled; they shrunk when tried
 By ghostly power: but Time's unsparing hand
 Hath plucked such foes, like weeds, from out the land;
 And now, if men with men in peace abide,
 All other strength the weakest may withstand,
 All worse assaults may safely be defied.
