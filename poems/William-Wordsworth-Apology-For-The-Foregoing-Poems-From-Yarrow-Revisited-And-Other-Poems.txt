 No more: the end is sudden and abrupt,
 Abrupt, as without preconceived design
 Was the beginning; yet the several Lays
 Have moved in order, to each other bound
 By a continuous and acknowledged tie
 Though unapparent, like those Shapes distinct
 That yet survive ensculptured on the walls
 Of palaces, or temples, 'mid the wreck
 Of famed Persepolis; each following each,
 As might beseem a stately embassy,
 In set array; these bearing in their hands
 Ensign of civil power, weapon of war,
 Or gift to be presented at the throne
 Of the Great King; and others, as they go
 In priestly vest, with holy offerings charged,
 Or leading victims drest for sacrifice.
 Nor will the Power we serve, that sacred Power,
 The Spirit of humanity, disdain
 A ministration humble but sincere,
 That from a threshold loved by every Muse
 Its impulse took, that sorrow-stricken door,
 Whence, as a current from its fountain-head,
 Our thoughts have issued, and our feelings flowed,
 Receiving, willingly or not, fresh strength
 From kindred sources; while around us sighed
 (Life's three first seasons having passed away)
 Leaf-scattering winds; and hoar-frost sprinklings fell
 (Foretaste of winter) on the moorland heights;
 And every day brought with it tidings new
 Of rash change, ominous for the public weal.
 Hence, if dejection has too oft encroached
 Upon that sweet and tender melancholy
 Which may itself be cherished and caressed
 More than enough; a fault so natural
 (Even with the young, the hopeful, or the gay)
 For prompt forgiveness will not sue in vain.
