On Seeing The Foundation Preparing For The Erection Of Rydal Chapel, Westmoreland.


 I

 Blest is this Isle, our native Land;
 Where battlement and moated gate
 Are objects only for the hand
 Of hoary Time to decorate;
 Where shady hamlet, town that breathes
 Its busy smoke in social wreaths,
 No rampart's stern defense require,
 Nought but the heaven-directed spire,
 And steeple tower (with pealing bells
 Far-heard) our only citadels.

 II

 O Lady! from a noble line
 Of chieftains sprung, who stoutly bore
 The spear, yet gave to works divine
 A bounteous help in days of yore,
 (As records mouldering in the Dell
 Of Nightshade haply yet may tell;)
 Thee kindred aspirations moved
 To build, within a vale beloved,
 For Him upon whose high behests
 All peace depends, all safety rests.

 III

 How fondly will the woods embrace
 This daughter of thy pious care,
 Lifting her front with modest grace
 To make a fair recess more fair;
 And to exalt the passing hour;
 Or soothe it with a healing power
 Drawn from the Sacrifice fulfilled,
 Before this rugged soil was tilled,
 Or human habitation rose
 To interrupt the deep repose!

 IV

 Well may the villagers rejoice!
 Nor heat, nor cold, nor weary ways,
 Will be a hindrance to the voice
 That would unite in prayer and praise;
 More duly shall wild wandering Youth
 Receive the curb of sacred truth,
 Shall tottering Age, bent earthward, hear
 The Promise, with uplifted ear;
 And all shall welcome the new ray
 Imparted to their sabbath-day.

 V

 Nor deem the Poet's hope misplaced,
 His fancy cheated, that can see
 A shade upon the future cast,
 Of time's pathetic sanctity;
 Can hear the monitory clock
 Sound o'er the lake with gentle shock
 At evening, when the ground beneath
 Is ruffled o'er with cells of death;
 Where happy generations lie,
 Here tutored for eternity.

 VI

 Lives there a man whose sole delights
 Are trivial pomp and city noise,
 Hardening a heart that loathes or slights
 What every natural heart enjoys?
 Who never caught a noon-tide dream
 From murmur of a running stream;
 Could strip, for aught the prospect yields
 To him, their verdure from the fields;
 And take the radiance from the clouds
 In which the sun his setting shrouds.

 VII

 A soul so pitiably forlorn,
 If such do on this earth abide,
 May season apathy with scorn,
 May turn indifference to pride;
 And still be not unblest compared
 With him who grovels, self-debarred
 From all that lies within the scope
 Of holy faith and Christian hope;
 Or, shipwrecked, kindles on the coast
 False fires, that others may be lost.

 VIII

 Alas! that such perverted zeal
 Should spread on Britain's favoured ground!
 That public order, private weal,
 Should e'er have felt or feared a wound
 From champions of the desperate law
 Which from their own blind hearts they draw;
 Who tempt their reason to deny
 God, whom their passions dare defy,
 And boast that they alone are free
 Who reach this dire extremity!

 IX

 But turn we from these "bold bad" men;
 The way, mild Lady! that hath led
 Down to their dark opprobrious den,"
 Is all too rough for Thee to tread.
 Softly as morning vapours glide
 Down Rydal-cove from Fairfield's side,
 Should move the tenor of 'his' song
 Who means to charity no wrong;
 Whose offering gladly would accord
 With this day's work, in thought and word.

 X

 Heaven prosper it! may peace, and love,
 And hope, and consolation, fall,
 Through its meek influence, from above,
 And penetrate the hearts of all;
 All who, around the hallowed Fane,
 Shall sojourn in this fair domain;
 Grateful to Thee, while service pure,
 And ancient ordinance, shall endure,
 For opportunity bestowed
 To kneel together, and adore their God!
