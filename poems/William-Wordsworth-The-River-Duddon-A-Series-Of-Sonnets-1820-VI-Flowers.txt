 Ere yet our course was graced with social trees
 It lacked not old remains of hawthorn bowers,
 Where small birds warbled to their paramours;
 And, earlier still, was heard the hum of bees;
 I saw them ply their harmless robberies,
 And caught the fragrance which the sundry flowers,
 Fed by the stream with soft perpetual showers,
 Plenteously yielded to the vagrant breeze.
 There bloomed the strawberry of the wilderness;
 The trembling eyebright showed her sapphire blue,
 The thyme her purple, like the blush of Even;
 And if the breath of some to no caress
 Invited, forth they peeped so fair to view,
 All kinds alike seemed favourites of Heaven.
