title: A Waft Of Perfume
---

A waft of perfume from a bit of lace
 Moved lightly by a passing woman's hand;
And on the common street, a sensuous grace
 Shone suddenly from some lost time and land.

Tall structures changed to dome and parapet;
 The stern-faced Church an oracle became;
In sheltered alcoves marble busts were set;
 And on the wall frail Lais wrote her name.

Phryne before her judges stood at bay,
 Fearing the rigour of Athenian laws;
Till Hyperides tore her cloak away,
 And bade her splendid beauty plead its cause.

Great Alexander walking in the dusk,
 Dreamed of the hour when Greek with Greek should meet;
From Thais' window attar breathed, and musk:
 His footsteps went no farther down the street.

Faint and more faint the pungent perfume grew;
 Of wall and parapet remained no trace.
Temple and statue vanished from the view:
 The city street again was commonplace.
