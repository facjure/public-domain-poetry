The wisest of the wise
Listen to pretty lies
And love to hear them told;
Doubt not that Solomon
Listen�d to many a one,
Some in his youth, and more when he grew old.

I never was among
The choir of Wisdom�s song,
But pretty lies lov�d I
As much as any king,
When youth was on the wing,
And (must it then be told?) when youth had quite gone by.

Alas! and I have not
The pleasant hour forgot
When one pert lady said,
�O Walter! I am quite
Bewilder�d with affright!
I see (sit quiet now) a white hair on your head!�

Another more benign
Snipp�d it away from mine,
And in her own dark hair
Pretended it was found�
She leap�d, and twirl�d it round�
Fair as she was, she never was so fair!
