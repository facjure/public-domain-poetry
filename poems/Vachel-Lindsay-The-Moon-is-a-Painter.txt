(Moon Poems for the Children/Fairy-tales for the Children)

 He coveted her portrait.
 He toiled as she grew gay.
 She loved to see him labor
 In that devoted way.

 And in the end it pleased her,
 But bowed him more with care.
 Her rose-smile showed so plainly,
 Her soul-smile was not there.

 That night he groped without a lamp
 To find a cloak, a book,
 And on the vexing portrait
 By moonrise chanced to look.

 The color-scheme was out of key,
 The maiden rose-smile faint,
 But through the blessed darkness
 She gleamed, his friendly saint.

 The comrade, white, immortal,
 His bride, and more than bride - 
 The citizen, the sage of mind,
 For whom he lived and died.
