Written for Lorado Taft's Statue of Black Hawk at Oregon, Illinois



To be given in the manner of the Indian Oration and the Indian War-Cry.


 Hawk of the Rocks,
 Yours is our cause to-day.
 Watching your foes
 Here in our war array,
 Young men we stand,
 Wolves of the West at bay.
Power, power for war
Comes from these trees divine;
Power from the boughs,
Boughs where the dew-beads shine,
Power from the cones - 
Yea, from the breath of the pine!

 Power to restore
 All that the white hand mars.
 See the dead east
 Crushed with the iron cars - 
 Chimneys black
 Blinding the sun and stars!

 Hawk of the pines,
 Hawk of the plain-winds fleet,
 You shall be king
 There in the iron street,
 Factory and forge
 Trodden beneath your feet.

 There will proud trees
 Grow as they grow by streams.
 There will proud thoughts
 Walk as in warrior dreams.
 There will proud deeds
 Bloom as when battle gleams!

 Warriors of Art,
 We will hold council there,
 Hewing in stone
 Things to the trapper fair,
 Painting the gray
 Veils that the spring moons wear,
 This our revenge,
 This one tremendous change:
 Making new towns,
 Lit with a star-fire strange,
 Wild as the dawn
 Gilding the bison-range.

 All the young men
 Chanting your cause that day,
 Red-men, new-made
 Out of the Saxon clay,
 Strong and redeemed,
 Bold in your war-array!
