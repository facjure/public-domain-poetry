title: Men Improve With The Years
---

I am worn out with dreams;
A weather-worn, marble triton
Among the streams;
And all day long I look
Upon this lady�s beauty
As though I had found in book
A pictured beauty,
Pleased to have filled the eyes
Or the discerning ears,
Delighted to be but wise,
For men improve with the years;
And yet and yet
Is this my dream, or the truth?
O would that we had met
When I had my burning youth;
But I grow old among dreams,
A weather-worn, marble triton
Among the streams.
