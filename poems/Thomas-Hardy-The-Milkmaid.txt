title: The Milkmaid

 Under a daisied bank
There stands a rich red ruminating cow,
 And hard against her flank
A cotton-hooded milkmaid bends her brow.

 The flowery river-ooze
Upheaves and falls; the milk purrs in the pail;
 Few pilgrims but would choose
The peace of such a life in such a vale.

 The maid breathes words - to vent,
It seems, her sense of Nature's scenery,
 Of whose life, sentiment,
And essence, very part itself is she.

 She bends a glance of pain,
And, at a moment, lets escape a tear;
 Is it that passing train,
Whose alien whirr offends her country ear? -

 Nay! Phyllis does not dwell
On visual and familiar things like these;
 What moves her is the spell
Of inner themes and inner poetries:

 Could but by Sunday morn
Her gay new gown come, meads might dry to dun,
 Trains shriek till ears were torn,
If Fred would not prefer that Other One.
