title: The Isle.

There was a little lawny islet
By anemone and violet,
Like mosaic, paven:
And its roof was flowers and leaves
Which the summer's breath enweaves,
Where nor sun nor showers nor breeze
Pierce the pines and tallest trees,
Each a gem engraven; -
Girt by many an azure wave
With which the clouds and mountains pave
A lake's blue chasm.
