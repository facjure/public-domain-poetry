 The trees along this city street,
 Save for the traffic and the trains,
 Would make a sound as thin and sweet
 As trees in country lanes.

 And people standing in their shade
 Out of a shower, undoubtedly
 Would hear such music as is made
 Upon a country tree.

 Oh, little leaves that are so dumb
 Against the shrieking city air,
 I watch you when the wind has come,--
 I know what sound is there.
