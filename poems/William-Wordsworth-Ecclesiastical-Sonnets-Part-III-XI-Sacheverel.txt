 A sudden conflict rises from the swell
 Of a proud slavery met by tenets strained
 In Liberty's behalf. Fears, true or feigned,
 Spread through all ranks; and lo! the Sentinel
 Who loudest rang his pulpit 'larum bell,
 Stands at the Bar, absolved by female eyes
 Mingling their glances with grave flatteries
 Lavished on 'Him', that England may rebel
 Against her ancient virtue. high and low,
 Watchwords of Party, on all tongues are rife;
 As if a Church, though sprung from heaven, must owe
 To opposites and fierce extremes her life,
 Not to the golden mean, and quiet flow
 Of truths that soften hatred, temper strife.
