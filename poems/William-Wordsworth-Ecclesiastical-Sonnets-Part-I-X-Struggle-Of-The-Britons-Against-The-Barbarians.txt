 Rise! they 'have' risen: of brave Aneurin ask
 How they have scourged old foes, perfidious friends:
 The Spirit of Caractacus descends
 Upon the Patriots, animates their task;
 Amazement runs before the towering casque
 Of Arthur, bearing through the stormy field
 The virgin sculptured on his Christian shield:
 Stretched in the sunny light of victory bask
 The Host that followed Urien as he strode
 O'er heaps of slain; from Cambrian wood and moss
 Druids descend, auxiliars of the Cross;
 Bards, nursed on blue Plinlimmon's still abode,
 Rush on the fight, to harps preferring swords,
 And everlasting deeds to burning words!
