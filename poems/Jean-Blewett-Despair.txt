We catch a glimpse of it, gaunt and gray,
 When the golden sunbeams are all abroad;
We sober a moment, then softly say:
 The world still lies in the hand of God.

We watch it stealthily creeping o'er
 The threshold leading to somebody's soul;
A shadow, we cry, it cannot be more
 When faith is one's portion and Heaven one's goal.

A ghost that comes stealing its way along,
 Affrighting the weak with its gruesome air,
But who that is young and glad and strong
 Fears for a moment to meet Despair?

To this heart of ours we have thought so bold
 All uninvited it comes one day - 
Lo! faith grows wan, and love grows cold,
 And the heaven of our dreams lies far away.
