title: A Place Of Burial In The South Of Scotland
---

 Part fenced by man, part by a rugged steep
 That curbs a foaming brook, a Grave-yard lies;
 The hare's best couching-place for fearless sleep;
 Which moonlit elves, far seen by credulous eyes,
 Enter in dance. Of church, or sabbath ties,
 No vestige now remains; yet thither creep
 Bereft Ones, and in lowly anguish weep
 Their prayers out to the wind and naked skies.
 Proud tomb is none; but rudely-sculptured knights,
 By humble choice of plain old times, are seen
 Level with earth, among the hillocks green:
 Union not sad, when sunny daybreak smites
 The spangled turf, and neighbouring thickets ring
 With 'jubilate' from the choirs of spring!
