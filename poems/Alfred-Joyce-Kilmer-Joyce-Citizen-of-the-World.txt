 No longer of Him be it said
 "He hath no place to lay His head."

 In every land a constant lamp
 Flames by His small and mighty camp.

 There is no strange and distant place
 That is not gladdened by His face.

 And every nation kneels to hail
 The Splendour shining through Its veil.

 Cloistered beside the shouting street,
 Silent, He calls me to His feet.

 Imprisoned for His love of me
 He makes my spirit greatly free.

 And through my lips that uttered sin
 The King of Glory enters in.
