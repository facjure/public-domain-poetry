title: The Jay In The Feathers Of The Peacock.

[1]

 A peacock moulted: soon a jay was seen
 Bedeck'd with Argus tail of gold and green,[2]
 High strutting, with elated crest,
 As much a peacock as the rest.
 His trick was recognized and bruited,
 His person jeer'd at, hiss'd, and hooted.
 The peacock gentry flock'd together,
 And pluck'd the fool of every feather.
 Nay more, when back he sneak'd to join his race,
 They shut their portals in his face.

 There is another sort of jay,
 The number of its legs the same,
 Which makes of borrow'd plumes display,
 And plagiary is its name.
 But hush! the tribe I'll not offend;
 'Tis not my work their ways to mend.
