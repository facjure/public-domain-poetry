I

 I saw a dead man's finer part
Shining within each faithful heart
Of those bereft. Then said I: "This must be
 His immortality."

II

 I looked there as the seasons wore,
And still his soul continuously upbore
Its life in theirs. But less its shine excelled
 Than when I first beheld.

III

 His fellow-yearsmen passed, and then
In later hearts I looked for him again;
And found him - shrunk, alas! into a thin
 And spectral mannikin.

IV

 Lastly I ask - now old and chill -
If aught of him remain unperished still;
And find, in me alone, a feeble spark,
 Dying amid the dark.

February 1899.
