 I know where lurk
 The eyes of Fear;
 I, I alone,
 Where shadowy-clear,
 Watching for me,
 Lurks Fear.

 'Tis ever still
 And dark, despite
 All singing and
 All candlelight,
 'Tis ever cold,
 And night.

 He touches me;
 Says quietly,
 "Stir not, nor whisper,
 I am nigh;
 Walk noiseless on,
 I am by!"

 He drives me
 As a dog a sheep;
 Like a cold stone
 I cannot weep.
 He lifts me
 Hot from sleep

 In marble hands
 To where on high
 The jewelled horror
 Of his eye
 Dares me to struggle
 Or cry.

 No breast wherein
 To chase away
 That watchful shape!
 Vain, vain to say
 "Haunt not with night
 The Day!"
