 While flowing rivers yield a blameless sport,
 Shall live the name of Walton: Sage benign!
 Whose pen, the mysteries of the rod and line
 Unfolding, did not fruitlessly exhort
 To reverend watching of each still report
 That Nature utters from her rural shrine.
 Meek, nobly versed in simple discipline,
 He found the longest summer day too short,
 To his loved pastime given by sedgy Lee,
 Or down the tempting maze of Shawford brook,
 Fairer than life itself, in this sweet Book,
 The cowslip-bank and shady willow-tree;
 And the fresh meads where flowed, from every nook
 Of his full bosom, gladsome Piety!
