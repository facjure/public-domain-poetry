Fair things are slow to fade away,
Bear witness you, that yesterday1
From out the Ghost of Pindar inyou
Roll�d an Olympian; and they say2

That here the torpid mummy wheat
Of Egypt bore a grain as sweet
As that which gilds the glebe of England,
Sunn�d with a summer of milder heat.

So may this legend for awhile,
If greeted by your classic smile,
Tho� dead in its Trinacrian Enna,
Blossom again on a colder isle.
