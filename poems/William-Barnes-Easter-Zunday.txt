Last Easter Jim put on his blue
Frock cwoat, the vu�st time-vier new;
Wi� yollow buttons all o� brass,
That glitter�d in the zun lik� glass;
An� pok�d �ithin the button-hole
A tutty he�d a-begg�d or stole.
A span-new wes-co�t, too, he wore,
Wi� yellow stripes all down avore;
An� tied his breeches� lags below
The knee, wi� ribbon in a bow;
An� drow�d his kitty-boots azide,
An� put his laggens on, an� tied
His shoes wi� strings two vingers wide,
Because �twer Easter Zunday.

An� after mornen church wer out
He come back hwome, an� stroll�d about
All down the vields, an� drough the leane,
Wi� sister Kit an� cousin Jeane,
A-turnen proudly to their view
His yollow breast an� back o� blue.
The lambs did play, the grounds wer green,
The trees did bud, the zun did sheen;
The lark did zing below the sky,
An� roads wer all a-blown so dry,
As if the zummer wer begun;
An� he had sich a bit o� fun!
He meade the maidens squeal an� run,
Because �twer Easter Zunday.
