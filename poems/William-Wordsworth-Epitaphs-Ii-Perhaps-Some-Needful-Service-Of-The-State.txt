title: Epitaphs Ii. Perhaps Some Needful Service Of The State
---

 Perhaps some needful service of the State
 Drew TITUS from the depth of studious bowers,
 And doomed him to contend in faithless courts,
 Where gold determines between right and wrong.
 Yet did at length his loyalty of heart,
 And his pure native genius, lead him back
 To wait upon the bright and gracious Muses,
 Whom he had early loved. And not in vain
 Such course he held! Bologna's learned schools
 Were gladdened by the Sage's voice, and hung
 With fondness on those sweet Nestorian strains.
 There pleasure crowned his days; and all his thoughts
 A roseate fragrance breathed. O human life,
 That never art secure from dolorous change!
 Behold a high injunction suddenly
 To Arno's side hath brought him, and he charmed
 A Tuscan audience: but full soon was called
 To the perpetual silence of the grave.
 Mourn, Italy, the loss of him who stood
 A Champion stedfast and invincible,
 To quell the rage of literary War!
