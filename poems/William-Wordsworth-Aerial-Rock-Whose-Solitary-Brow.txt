title: Aerial Rock - Whose Solitary Brow
---

 Aerial Rock, whose solitary brow
 From this low threshold daily meets my sight;
 When I step forth to hail the morning light;
 Or quit the stars with a lingering farewell, how
 Shall Fancy pay to thee a grateful vow?
 How, with the Muse's aid, her love attest?
 By planting on thy naked head the crest
 Of an imperial Castle, which the plough
 Of ruin shall not touch. Innocent scheme!
 That doth presume no more than to supply
 A grace the sinuous vale and roaring stream
 Want, through neglect of hoar Antiquity.
 Rise, then, ye votive Towers! and catch a gleam
 Of golden sunset, ere it fade and die.
