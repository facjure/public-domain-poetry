 There runs a crisscross pattern of small leaves
 Espalier, in a fading summer air,
 And there Ophelia walks, an azure flower,
 Whom wind, and snowflakes, and the sudden rain
 Of love's wild skies have purified to heaven.
 There is a beauty past all weeping now
 In that sweet, crooked mouth, that vacant smile;
 Only a lonely grey in those mad eyes,
 Which never on earth shall learn their loneliness.
 And when amid startled birds she sings lament,
 Mocking in hope the long voice of the stream,
 It seems her heart's lute hath a broken string.
 Ivy she hath, that to old ruin clings;
 And rosemary, that sees remembrance fade;
 And pansies, deeper than the gloom of dreams;
 But ah! if utterable, would this earth
 Remain the base, unreal thing it is?
 Better be out of sight of peering eyes;
 Out - out of hearing of all-useless words,
 Spoken of tedious tongues in heedless ears.
 And lest, at last, the world should learn heart-secrets;
 Lest that sweet wolf from some dim thicket steal;
 Better the glassy horror of the stream.
