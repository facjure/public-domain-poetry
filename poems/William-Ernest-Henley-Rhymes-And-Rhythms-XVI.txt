One with the ruined sunset,
 The strange forsaken sands,
What is it waits and wanders
 And signs with desperate hands?

What is it calls in the twilight,
 Calls as its chance were vain?
The cry of a gull sent seaward
 Or the voice of an ancient pain?

The red ghost of the sunset,
 It walks them as its own,
These dreary and desolate reaches . . .
 But O that it walked alone!
