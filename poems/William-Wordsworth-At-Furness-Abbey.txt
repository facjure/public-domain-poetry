 Well have yon Railway Labourers to THIS ground
 Withdrawn for noontide rest. They sit, they walk
 Among the Ruins, but no idle talk
 Is heard; to grave demeanour all are bound;
 And from one voice a Hymn with tuneful sound
 Hallows once more the long-deserted Quire
 And thrills the old sepulchral earth, around.
 Others look up, and with fixed eyes admire
 That wide-spanned arch, wondering how it was raised,
 To keep, so high in air, its strength and grace:
 All seem to feel the spirit of the place,
 And by the general reverence God is praised:
 Profane Despoilers, stand ye not reproved,
 While thus these simple-hearted men are moved?
