title: The River Duddon - A Series Of Sonnets, 1820. - XXIX - No Record Tells Of Lance Opposed To Lance
---

 No record tells of lance opposed to lance,
 Horse charging horse, 'mid these retired domains;
 Tells that their turf drank purple from the veins
 Of heroes, fallen, or struggling to advance,
 Till doubtful combat issued in a trance
 Of victory, that struck through heart and reins
 Even to the inmost seat of mortal pains,
 And lightened o'er the pallid countenance.
 Yet, to the loyal and the brave, who lie
 In the blank earth, neglected and forlorn,
 The passing Winds memorial tribute pay;
 The Torrents chant their praise, inspiring scorn
 Of power usurped; with proclamation high,
 And glad acknowledgment, of lawful sway.
