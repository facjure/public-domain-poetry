title: Mary Called Him 'Mister'
---

They'd parted but a year before, she never thought he�d come,
She stammer�d, blushed, held out her hand, and called him �Mister Gum.�
How could he know that all the while she longed to murmur �John.�
He called her �Miss le Brook,� and asked how she was getting on.

They�d parted but a year before; they�d loved each other well,
But he�d been to the city, and he came back such a swell.
They longed to meet in fond embrace, they hungered for a kiss, 
But Mary called him �Mister,� and the idiot called her �Miss.�

He stood and lean�d against the door, a stupid chap was he, 
And, when she asked if he�d come in and have a cup of tea,
He looked to left, he looked to right, and then he glanced behind,
And slowly doffed his cabbage-tree, and said he �didn�t mind.�

She made a shy apology because the meat was tough,
And then she asked if he was sure his tea was sweet enough;
He stirred the tea and sipped it twice, and answer�d �plenty, quite;�
And cut the smallest piece of beef and said that it was �right.�

She glanced at him at times and cough�d an awkward little cough;
He stared at anything but her and said, �I must be off.�
That evening he went riding north, a sad and lonely ride, 
She locked herself inside her room, and there sat down and cried.

They�d parted but a year before, they loved each other well, 
But she was such a country girl and he was such a swell ;
They longed to meet in fond embrace, they hungered for a kiss, 
But Mary called him �Mister� and the idiot called her �Miss.
