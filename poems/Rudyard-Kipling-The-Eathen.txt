title: The �Eathen
---

The �eathen in �is blindness bows down to wood an� stone;
�E don�t obey no orders unless they is �is own;
�E keeps �is side-arms awful: �e leaves �em all about,
An� then comes up the regiment an� pokes the �eathen out.

All along o� dirtiness, all along o� mess,
All along o� doin� things rather-more-or-less,
All along of abby-nay, kul, an� hazar-ho,
Mind you keep your rifle an� yourself jus� so!

The young recruit is �aughty, �e draf�s from Gawd knows where;
They bid �im show �is stockin�s an� lay �is mattress square;
�E calls it bloomin� nonsense, �e doesn�t know no more,
An� then up comes �is Company an� kicks �im round the floor!

The young recruit is �ammered, �e takes it very �ard;
�E �angs �is �ead an� mutters, �e sulks about the yard;
�E talks o� �cruel tyrants� �e�ll swing for by-an�-by,
An� the others �ears an� mocks �im, an� the boy goes orf to cry.

The young recruit is silly, �e thinks o� suicide;
�E�s lost �is gutter-devil; �e �asn�t got �is pride;
But day by day they kicks �im, which �elps �im on a bit,
Till �e finds �isself one mornin� with a full an� proper kit.

Gettin� clear o� dirtiness, gettin� done with mess,
Gettin� shut o� doin� things rather-more-or-less;
Not so fond of abby-nay, kul, nor hazar-ho,
Learns to keep �is rifle an� �isself jus� so!

The young recruit is �appy, �e throws a chest to suit;
You see �im grow mustaches; you �ear �im slap �is boot;
�E learns to drop the �bloodies� from every word �e slings,
An� �e shows an �ealthy brisket when �e strips for bars an� rings.

The cruel-tyrant-sergeants they watch �im �arf a year;
They watch �im with �is comrades, they watch �im with �is beer;
They watch �im with the women at the regimental dance,
And the cruel-tyrant-sergeants send �is name along for �Lance�.

An� now �e�s �arf o� nothin�, an� all a private yet,
�Is room they up an� rags �im to see what they will get;
They rags �im low an� cunnin�, each dirty trick they can,
But �e learns to sweat �is temper an� �e learns to sweat �is man.

An�, last, a Colour-Sergeant, as such to be obeyed,
�E schools �is men at cricket, �e tells �em on parade;
They sees �em quick an� �andy, uncommon set an� smart,
An� so �e talks to orficers which �ave the Core at �eart.

�E learns to do �is watchin� without it showin� plain;
�E learns to save a dummy, an� shove �im straight again;
�E learns to check a ranker that�s buyin� leave to shirk;
An� �e learns to make men like �im so they�ll learn to like their work.

An� when it comes to marchin� he�ll see their socks are right,
An� when it comes to action �e shows �em �ow to sight;
�E knows their ways of thinkin� and just what�s in their mind;
�E knows when they are takin� on an� when they�ve fell be�ind.

�E knows each talkin� corpril that leads a squad astray;
�E feels �is innards �eavin�, �is bowels givin� way;
�E sees the blue-white faces all tryin� �ard to grin,
An� �e stands an� waits an� suffers till it�s time to cap �em in.

An� now the hugly bullets come peckin� through the dust,
An� no one wants to face �em, but every beggar must;
So, like a man in irons which isn�t glad to go,
They moves �em off by companies uncommon stiff an� slow.

Of all �is five years� schoolin� they don�t remember much
Excep� the not retreatin�, the step an� keepin� touch.
It looks like teachin� wasted when they duck an� spread an� �op,
But if �e �adn�t learned �em they�d be all about the shop!

An� now it�s ��Oo goes backward?� an� now it�s ��Oo comes on?�
And now it�s �Get the doolies,� an� now the captain�s gone;
An� now it�s bloody murder, but all the while they �ear
�Is voice, the same as barrick drill, a-shepherdin� the rear.

�E�s just as sick as they are, �is �eart is like to split,
But �e works �em, works �em, works �em till he feels �em take the bit;
The rest is �oldin� steady till the watchful bugles play,
An� �e lifts �em, lifts �em, lifts �em through the charge that wins the day!

The �eathen in �is blindness bows down to wood an� stone;
�E don�t obey no orders unless they is �is own;
The �eathen in �is blindness must end where �e began,
But the backbone of the Army is the non-commissioned man!

Keep away from dirtiness, keep away from mess.
Don�t get into doin� things rather-more-or-less!
Let�s ha� done with abby-nay, kul, an� hazar-ho;
Mind you keep your rifle an� yourself jus� so!
