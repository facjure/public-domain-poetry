"Tum porro puer, ut saevis projectus ab undis
Navita, nudus humi jacet, etc." Lucretius.



 Like a shipwrecked Sailor tost
 By rough waves on a perilous coast,
 Lies the Babe, in helplessness
 And in tenderest nakedness,
 Flung by labouring nature forth
 Upon the mercies of the earth.
 Can its eyes beseech? no more
 Than the hands are free to implore:
 Voice but serves for one brief cry;
 Plaint was it? or prophecy
 Of sorrow that will surely come?
 Omen of man's grievous doom!
 
 But, O Mother! by the close
 Duly granted to thy throes;
 By the silent thanks, now tending
 Incense-like to Heaven, descending
 Now to mingle and to move
 With the gush of earthly love,
 As a debt to that frail Creature,
 Instrument of struggling Nature
 For the blissful calm, the peace
 Known but to this 'one' release,
 Can the pitying spirit doubt
 That for human-kind springs out
 From the penalty a sense
 Of more than mortal recompense?
 
 As a floating summer cloud,
 Though of gorgeous drapery proud,
 To the sun-burnt traveler,
 Or the stooping labourer,
 Oft-times makes its bounty known
 By its shadow round him thrown;
 So, by chequerings of sad cheer,
 Heavenly Guardians, brooding near,
 Of their presence tell, too bright
 Haply for corporeal sight!
 Ministers of grace divine
 Feelingly their brows incline
 O'er this seeming Castaway
 Breathing, in the light of day,
 Something like the faintest breath
 That has power to baffle death,
 Beautiful, while very weakness
 Captivates like passive meekness.
 
 And, sweet Mother! under warrant
 Of the universal Parent,
 Who repays in season due
 Them who have, like thee, been true
 To the filial chain let down
 From his everlasting throne,
 Angels hovering round thy couch,
 With their softest whispers vouch,
 That, whatever griefs may fret,
 Cares entangle, sins beset,
 This thy First-born, and with tears
 Stain her cheek in future years,
 Heavenly succour, not denied
 To the babe, whate'er betide,
 Will to the woman be supplied!
 
 Mother! blest be thy calm ease;
 Blest the starry promises,
 And the firmament benign
 Hallowed be it, where they shine!
 Yes, for them whose souls have scope
 Ample for a winged hope,
 And can earthward bend an ear
 For needful listening, pledge is here,
 That, if thy new-born Charge shall tread
 In thy footsteps, and be led
 By that other Guide, whose light
 Of manly virtues, mildly bright,
 Gave him first the wished-for part
 In thy gentle virgin heart;
 Then, amid the storms of life
 Presignified by that dread strife
 Whence ye have escaped together,
 She may look for serene weather;
 In all trials sure to find
 Comfort for a faithful mind;
 Kindlier issues, holier rest,
 Than even now await her prest,
 Conscious Nursling, to thy breast!
