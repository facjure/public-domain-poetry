 I saw old Idleness, fat, with great cheeks
 Puffed to the huge circumference of a sigh,
 But past all tinge of apples long ago.
 His boyish fingers twiddled up and down
 The filthy remnant of a cup of physic
 That thicked in odour all the while he stayed.
 His eyes were sad as fishes that swim up
 And stare upon an element not theirs
 Through a thin skin of shrewish water, then
 Turn on a languid fin, and dip down, down,
 Into unplumbed, vast, oozy deeps of dream.
 His stomach was his master, and proclaimed it;
 And never were such meagre puppets made
 The slaves of such a tyrant, as his thoughts
 Of that obese epitome of ills.
 Trussed up he sat, the mockery of himself;
 And when upon the wan green of his eye
 I marked the gathering lustre of a tear,
 Thought I myself must weep, until I caught
 A grey, smug smile of satisfaction smirch
 His pallid features at his misery.
 And laugh did I, to see the little snares
 He had set for pests to vex him: his great feet
 Prisoned in greater boots; so narrow a stool
 To seat such elephantine parts as his;
 Ay, and the book he read, a Hebrew Bible;
 And, to incite a gross and backward wit,
 An old, crabbed, wormed, Greek dictionary; and
 A foxy Ovid bound in dappled calf.
