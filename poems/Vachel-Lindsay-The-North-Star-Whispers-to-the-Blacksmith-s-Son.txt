 The North Star whispers:"You are one
 Of those whose course no chance can change.
 You blunder, but are not undone,
 Your spirit-task is fixed and strange.

 "When here you walk, a bloodless shade,
 A singer all men else forget.
 Your chants of hammer, forge and spade
 Will move the prairie-village yet.

 "That young, stiff-necked, reviling town
 Beholds your fancies on her walls,
 And paints them out or tears them down,
 Or bars them from her feasting-halls.

 "Yet shall the fragments still remain;
 Yet shall remain some watch-tower strong
 That ivy-vines will not disdain,
 Haunted and trembling with your song.

 "Your flambeau in the dusk shall burn,
 Flame high in storms, flame white and clear;
 Your ghost in gleaming robes return
 And burn a deathless incense here."
