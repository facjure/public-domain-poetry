 At early dawn, or rather when the air
 Glimmers with fading light, and shadowy Eve
 Is busiest to confer and to bereave;
 Then, pensive Votary! let thy feet repair
 To Gordale-chasm, terrific as the lair
 Where the young lions couch; for so, by leave
 Of the propitious hour, thou may'st perceive
 The local Deity, with oozy hair
 And mineral crown, beside his jagged urn,
 Recumbent: Him thou may'st behold, who hides
 His lineaments by day, yet there presides,
 Teaching the docile waters how to turn,
 Or (if need be) impediment to spurn,
 And force their passage to the salt-see tides!
