title: In My Mind's Eye A Temple, Like A Cloud
---

 In my mind's eye a Temple, like a cloud
 Slowly surmounting some invidious hill,
 Rose out of darkness: the bright Work stood still:
 And might of its own beauty have been proud,
 But it was fashioned and to God was vowed
 By Virtues that diffused, in every part,
 Spirit divine through forms of human art:
 Faith had her arch, her arch, when winds blow loud,
 Into the consciousness of safety thrilled;
 And Love her towers of dread foundation laid
 Under the grave of things; Hope had her spire
 Star-high, and pointing still to something higher
 Trembling I gazed, but heard a voice it said,
 "Hell-gates are powerless Phantoms when 'we' build."
