I

 Breathe not, hid Heart: cease silently,
 And though thy birth-hour beckons thee,
 Sleep the long sleep:
 The Doomsters heap
 Travails and teens around us here,
And Time-wraiths turn our songsingings to fear.

II

 Hark, how the peoples surge and sigh,
 And laughters fail, and greetings die:
 Hopes dwindle; yea,
 Faiths waste away,
 Affections and enthusiasms numb;
Thou canst not mend these things if thou dost come.

III

 Had I the ear of wombed souls
 Ere their terrestrial chart unrolls,
 And thou wert free
 To cease, or be,
 Then would I tell thee all I know,
And put it to thee: Wilt thou take Life so?

IV

 Vain vow! No hint of mine may hence
 To theeward fly: to thy locked sense
 Explain none can
 Life's pending plan:
 Thou wilt thy ignorant entry make
Though skies spout fire and blood and nations quake.

V

 Fain would I, dear, find some shut plot
 Of earth's wide wold for thee, where not
 One tear, one qualm,
 Should break the calm.
 But I am weak as thou and bare;
No man can change the common lot to rare.

VI

 Must come and bide. And such are we -
 Unreasoning, sanguine, visionary -
 That I can hope
 Health, love, friends, scope
 In full for thee; can dream thou'lt find
Joys seldom yet attained by humankind!
