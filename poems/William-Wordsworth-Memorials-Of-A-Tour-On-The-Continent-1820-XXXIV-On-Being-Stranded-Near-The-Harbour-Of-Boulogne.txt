 Why cast ye back upon the Gallic shore,
 Ye furious waves! a patriotic Son
 Of England, who in hope her coast had won,
 His project crowned, his pleasant travel o'er?
 Well, let him pace this noted beach once more,
 That gave the Roman his triumphal shells;
 That saw the Corsican his cap and bells
 Haughtily shake, a dreaming Conqueror!
 Enough: my Country's cliffs I can behold,
 And proudly think, beside the chafing sea,
 Of checked ambition, tyranny controlled,
 And folly cursed with endless memory:
 These local recollections ne'er can cloy;
 Such ground I from my very heart enjoy!
