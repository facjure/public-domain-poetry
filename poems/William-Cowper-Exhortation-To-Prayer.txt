title: Exhortation To Prayer.
---

What various hindrances we meet
In coming to a mercy-seat!
Yet who that knows the worth of prayer,
But wishes to be often there?


Prayer makes the darken�d cloud withdraw,
Prayer climbs the ladder Jacob saw,
Gives exercise to faith and love,
Brings every blessing from above.


Restraining prayer, we cease to fight,
Prayer makes the Christian�s armour bright;
And Satan trembles when he sees
The weakest saint upon his knees.


While Moses stood with arms spread wide,
Success was found on Israel�s side;
But when through weariness they fail�d,
That moment Amalek prevail�d.[1]


Have you no words? Ah! think again,
Words flow apace when you complain,
And fill your fellow-creature�s ear
With the sad tale of all your care.


Were half the breath thus vainly spent
To Heaven in supplication sent,
Your cheerful song would oftener be,
�Hear what the Lord has done for me.�
