I

1.

Los smitten with astonishment
Frightend at the hurtling bones

2.

And at the surging sulphureous
Perturbed Immortal mad raging

3.

In whirlwinds &amp; pitch &amp; nitre
Round the furious limbs of Los

4.

And Los formed nets &amp; gins
And threw the nets round about

5.

He watch'd in shuddring fear
The dark changes &amp; bound every change
With rivets of iron &amp; brass;

6.

And these were the changes of Urizen.


II

1.

Ages on ages roll'd over him!
In stony sleep ages roll'd over him!
Like a dark waste stretching chang'able
By earthquakes riv'n, belching sullen fires
On ages roll'd ages in ghastly
Sick torment; around him in whirlwinds
Of darkness the eternal Prophet howl'd
Beating still on his rivets of iron
Pouring sodor of iron; dividing
The horrible night into watches.

2.

And Urizen (so his eternal name)
His prolific delight obscurd more &amp; more
In dark secresy hiding in surgeing
Sulphureous fluid his phantasies.
The Eternal Prophet heavd the dark bellows,
And turn'd restless the tongs; and the hammer
Incessant beat; forging chains new &amp; new
Numb'ring with links. hours, days &amp; years

3.

The eternal mind bounded began to roll
Eddies of wrath ceaseless round &amp; round,
And the sulphureous foam surgeing thick
Settled, a lake, bright, &amp; shining clear:
White as the snow on the mountains cold.

4.

Forgetfulness, dumbness, necessity!
In chains of the mind locked up,
Like fetters of ice shrinking together
Disorganiz'd, rent from Eternity,
Los beat on his fetters of iron;
And heated his furnaces &amp; pour'd
Iron sodor and sodor of brass

5.

Restless turnd the immortal inchain'd
Heaving dolorous! anguish'd! unbearable
Till a roof shaggy wild inclos'd
In an orb, his fountain of thought.

6.

In a horrible dreamful slumber;
Like the linked infernal chain;
A vast Spine writh'd in torment
Upon the winds; shooting pain'd
Ribs, like a bending cavern
And bones of solidness, froze
Over all his nerves of joy.
And a first Age passed over,
And a state of dismal woe.

7.

From the caverns of his jointed Spine,
Down sunk with fright a red
Round globe hot burning deep
Deep down into the Abyss:
Panting: Conglobing, Trembling
Shooting out ten thousand branches
Around his solid bones.
And a second Age passed over,
And a state of dismal woe.

8.

In harrowing fear rolling round;
His nervous brain shot branches
Round the branches of his heart.
On high into two little orbs
And fixed in two little caves
Hiding carefully from the wind,
His Eyes beheld the deep,
And a third Age passed over:
And a state of dismal woe.

9.

The pangs of hope began,
In heavy pain striving, struggling.
Two Ears in close volutions.
From beneath his orbs of vision
Shot spiring out and petrified
As they grew. And a fourth Age passed
And a state of dismal woe.

10.

In ghastly torment sick;
Hanging upon the wind;
Two Nostrils bent down to the deep.
And a fifth Age passed over;
And a state of dismal woe.

11.

In ghastly torment sick;
Within his ribs bloated round,
A craving Hungry Cavern;
Thence arose his channeld Throat,
And like a red flame a Tongue
Of thirst &amp; of hunger appeard.
And a sixth Age passed over:
And a state of dismal woe.

12.

Enraged &amp; stifled with torment
He threw his right Arm to the north
His left Arm to the south
Shooting out in anguish deep,
And his Feet stampd the nether Abyss
In trembling &amp; howling &amp; dismay.
And a seventh Age passed over:
And a state of dismal woe.
