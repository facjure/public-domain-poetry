title: The Hope of the Resurrection
---

 Though I have watched so many mourners weep
 O'er the real dead, in dull earth laid asleep - 
 Those dead seemed but the shadows of my days
 That passed and left me in the sun's bright rays.
 Now though you go on smiling in the sun
 Our love is slain, and love and you were one.
 You are the first, you I have known so long,
 Whose death was deadly, a tremendous wrong.
 Therefore I seek the faith that sets it right
 Amid the lilies and the candle-light.
 I think on Heaven, for in that air so clear
 We two may meet, confused and parted here.
 Ah, when man's dearest dies, 'tis then he goes
 To that old balm that heals the centuries' woes.
 Then Christ's wild cry in all the streets is rife: - 
 "I am the Resurrection and the Life."
