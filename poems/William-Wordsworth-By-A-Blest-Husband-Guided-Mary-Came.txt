title: By A Blest Husband Guided, Mary Came
---

 By a blest Husband guided, Mary came
 From nearest kindred, Vernon her new name;
 She came, though meek of soul, in seemly pride
 Of happiness and hope, a youthful Bride.
 O dread reverse! if aught 'be' so, which proves
 That God will chasten whom he dearly loves.
 Faith bore her up through pains in mercy given,
 And troubles that were each a step to Heaven:
 Two Babes were laid in earth before she died;
 A third now slumbers at the Mother's side;
 Its Sister-twin survives, whose smiles afford
 A trembling solace to her widowed Lord.
 
 Reader! if to thy bosom cling the pain
 Of recent sorrow combated in vain;
 Or if thy cherished grief have failed to thwart
 Time still intent on his insidious part,
 Lulling the mourner's best good thoughts asleep,
 Pilfering regrets we would, but cannot, keep;
 Bear with Him, judge 'Him' gently who makes known
 His bitter loss by this memorial Stone;
 And pray that in his faithful breast the grace
 Of resignation find a hallowed place.
