title: The Master of the Dance

A chant to which it is intended a group of children shall dance and improvise pantomime led by their dancing-teacher.


 I

 A master deep-eyed
 Ere his manhood was ripe,
 He sang like a thrush,
 He could play any pipe.
 So dull in the school
 That he scarcely could spell,
 He read but a bit,
 And he figured not well.
 A bare-footed fool,
 Shod only with grace;
 Long hair streaming down
 Round a wind-hardened face;
 He smiled like a girl,
 Or like clear winter skies,
 A virginal light
 Making stars of his eyes.
 In swiftness and poise,
 A proud child of the deer,
 A white fawn he was,
 Yet a fawn without fear.
 No youth thought him vain,
 Or made mock of his hair,
 Or laughed when his ways
 Were most curiously fair.
 A mastiff at fight,
 He could strike to the earth
 The envious one
 Who would challenge his worth.
 However we bowed
 To the schoolmaster mild,
 Our spirits went out
 To the fawn-footed child.
 His beckoning led
 Our troop to the brush.
 We found nothing there
 But a wind and a hush.
 He sat by a stone
 And he looked on the ground,
 As if in the weeds
 There was something profound.
 His pipe seemed to neigh,
 Then to bleat like a sheep,
 Then sound like a stream
 Or a waterfall deep.
 It whispered strange tales,
 Human words it spoke not.
 Told fair things to come,
 And our marvellous lot
 If now with fawn-steps
 Unshod we advanced
 To the midst of the grove
 And in reverence danced.
 We obeyed as he piped
 Soft grass to young feet,
 Was a medicine mighty,
 A remedy meet.
 Our thin blood awoke,
 It grew dizzy and wild,
 Though scarcely a word
 Moved the lips of a child.
 Our dance gave allegiance,
 It set us apart,
 We tripped a strange measure,
 Uplifted of heart.


 II

 We thought to be proud
 Of our fawn everywhere.
 We could hardly see how
 Simple books were a care.
 No rule of the school
 This strange student could tame.
 He was banished one day,
 While we quivered with shame.
 He piped back our love
 On a moon-silvered night,
 Enticed us once more
 To the place of delight.
 A greeting he sang
 And it made our blood beat,
 It tramped upon custom
 And mocked at defeat.
 He builded a fire
 And we tripped in a ring,
 The embers our books
 And the fawn our good king.
 And now we approached
 All the mysteries rare
 That shadowed his eyelids
 And blew through his hair.
 That spell now was peace
 The deep strength of the trees,
 The children of nature
 We clambered her knees.
 Our breath and our moods
 Were in tune with her own,
 Tremendous her presence,
 Eternal her throne.
 The ostracized child
 Our white foreheads kissed,
 Our bodies and souls
 Became lighter than mist.
 Sweet dresses like snow
 Our small lady-loves wore,
 Like moonlight the thoughts
 That our bosoms upbore.
 Like a lily the touch
 Of each cold little hand.
 The loves of the stars
 We could now understand.
 O quivering air!
 O the crystalline night!
 O pauses of awe
 And the faces swan-white!
 O ferns in the dusk!
 O forest-shrined hour!
 O earth that sent upward
 The thrill and the power,
 To lift us like leaves,
 A delirious whirl,
 The masterful boy
 And the delicate girl!
 What child that strange night-time
 Can ever forget?
 His fealty due
 And his infinite debt
 To the folly divine,
 To the exquisite rule
 Of the perilous master,
 The fawn-footed fool?


 III

 Now soldiers we seem,
 And night brings a new thing,
 A terrible ire,
 As of thunder awing.
 A warrior power,
 That old chivalry stirred,
 When knights took up arms,
 As the maidens gave word.
 THE END OF OUR WAR,
 WILL BE GLORY UNTOLD.
 WHEN THE TOWN LIKE A GREAT
 BUDDING ROSE SHALL UNFOLD!
 Near, nearer that war,
 And that ecstasy comes,
 We hear the trees beating
 Invisible drums.
 The fields of the night
 Are starlit above,
 Our girls are white torches
 Of conquest and love.
 No nerve without will,
 And no breast without breath,
 We whirl with the planets
 That never know death!
