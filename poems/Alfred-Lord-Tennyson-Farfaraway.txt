What sight so lured him thro� the fields he knew
As where earth�s green stole into heaven�s own hue,

Far�far�away?

What sound was dearest in his native dells?
The mellow lin-lan-lone of evening bells

Far�far�away.

What vague world-whisper, mystic pain or joy,
Thro� those three words would haunt him when a boy,

Far�far�away?

A whisper from his dawn of life? a breath
From some fair dawn beyond the doors of death

Far�far�away?

Far, far, how far? from o�er the gates of Birth,
The faint horizons, all the bounds of earth,

Far�far�away?

What charm in words, a charm no words could give?
O dying words, can Music make you live

Far�far�away?
