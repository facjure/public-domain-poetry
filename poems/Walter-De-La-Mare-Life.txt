 Hearken, O dear, now strikes the hour we die;
 We, who in our strange kiss
 Have proved a dream the world's realities,
 Turned each from other's darkness with a sigh,
 Need heed no more of life, waste no more breath
 On any other journey, but of death.

 And yet: Oh, know we well
 How each of us must prove Love's infidel;
 Still out of ecstasy turn trembling back
 To earth's same empty track
 Of leaden day by day, and hour by hour, and be
 Of all things lovely the cold mortuary.
