 If these brief Records, by the Muses' art
 Produced as lonely Nature or the strife
 That animates the scenes of public life
 Inspired, may in thy leisure claim a part;
 And if these Transcripts of the private heart
 Have gained a sanction from thy falling tears;
 Then I repent not. But my soul hath fears
 Breathed from eternity; for, as a dart
 Cleaves the blank air, Life flies: now every day
 Is but a glimmering spoke in the swift wheel
 Of the revolving week. Away, away,
 All fitful cares, all transitory zeal!
 So timely Grace the immortal wing may heal,
 And honour rest upon the senseless clay.
