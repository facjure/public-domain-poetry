title: Laughing And Sneering
---

What though the world does me ill turns
And cares my life environ;
I�d sooner laugh with Bobbie Burns
Than sneer with titled Byron.

The smile has always been the best;
�Tis stronger than the frown, sirs:
And Venus smiled the waves to rest;
She didn�t sneer them down, sirs.
