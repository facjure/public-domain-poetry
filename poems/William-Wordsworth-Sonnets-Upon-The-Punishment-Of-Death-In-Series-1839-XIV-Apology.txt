 The formal World relaxes her cold chain
 For One who speaks in numbers; ampler scope
 His utterance finds; and, conscious of the gain,
 Imagination works with bolder hope
 The cause of grateful reason to sustain;
 And, serving Truth, the heart more strongly beats
 Against all barriers which his labour meets
 In lofty place, or humble Life's domain.
 Enough; before us lay a painful road,
 And guidance have I sought in duteous love
 From Wisdom's heavenly Father. Hence hath flowed
 Patience, with trust that, whatsoe'er the way
 Each takes in this high matter, all may move
 Cheered with the prospect of a brighter day.
