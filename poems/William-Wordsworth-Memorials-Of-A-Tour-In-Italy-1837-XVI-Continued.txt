 The world forsaken, all its busy cares
 And stirring interests shunned with desperate flight,
 All trust abandoned in the healing might
 Of virtuous action; all that courage dares,
 Labour accomplishes, or patience bears
 Those helps rejected, they, whose minds perceive
 How subtly works man's weakness, sighs may heave
 For such a One beset with cloistral snares.
 Father of Mercy! rectify his view,
 If with his vows this object ill agree;
 Shed over it thy grace, and thus subdue
 Imperious passion in a heart set free:
 That earthly love may to herself be true,
 Give him a soul that cleaveth unto thee.
