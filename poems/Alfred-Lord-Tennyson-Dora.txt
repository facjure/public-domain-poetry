With farmer Allan at the farm abode
William and Dora. William was his son,
And she his niece. He often look�d at them,
And often thought, �I�ll make them man and wife.�
Now Dora felt her uncle�s will in all,
And yearn�d toward William; but the youth, because
He had been always with her in the house,
Thought not of Dora.
Then there came a day
When Allan call�d his son, and said, �My son
I married late, but I would wish to see
My grandchild on my knees before I die
And I have set my heart upon a match.
Now therefore look to Dora; she is well
To look to; thrifty too beyond her age.
She is my brother�s daughter: he and I
Had once hard words, and parted, and he died
In foreign lands; but for his sake I bred
His daughter Dora: take her for your wife;
For I have wish�d this marriage, night and day,
For many years.� But William answer�d short;
�I cannot marry Dora; by my life,
I will not marry Dora.� Then the old man
Was wroth, and doubled up his hands, and said
�You will not, boy! you dare to answer thus!
But in my time a father�s word was law,
And so it shall be now for me. Look to it;
Consider, William: take a month to think,
And let me have an answer to my wish;
Or, by the Lord that made me, you shall pack,
And never more darken my doors again.�
But William answer�d madly; bit his lips,
And broke away. The more he look�d at her
The less he liked her; and his ways were harsh;
But Dora bore them meekly. Then before
The month was out he left his father�s house,
And hired himself to work within the fields;
And half in love, half spite, he woo�d and wed
A labourer�s daughter, Mary Morrison.
Then, when the bells were ringing, Allan call�d
His niece and said: �My girl, I love you well;
But if you speak with him that was my son,
Or change a word with her he calls his wife,
My home is none of yours. My will is law.�
And Dora promised, being meek. She thought,
�It cannot be: my uncle�s mind will change!�
And days went on, and there was born a boy
To William; then distresses came on him;
And day by day he pass�d his father�s gate,
Heart-broken, and his father help�d him not.
But Dora stored what little she could save.
And sent it them by stealth, nor did they know
Who sent it; till at last a fever seized
On William, and in harvest time he died.
Then Dora went to Mary. Mary sat
And look�d with tears upon her boy, and thought
Hard things of Dora. Dora came and said
�I have obey�d my uncle until now,
And I have sinn�d, for it was all thro� me
This evil came on William at the first.
But, Mary, for the sake of him that�s gone,
And for your sake, the woman that he chose,
And for this orphan, I am come to you
You know there has not been for these five years
So full a harvest: let me take the boy,
And I will set him in my uncle�s eye
Among the wheat; that when his heart is glad
Of the full harvest, he may see the boy,
And bless him for the sake of him that�s gone.�
And Dora took the child, and went her way
Across the wheat, and sat upon a mound
That was unsown, where many poppies grew.
Far off the farmer came into the field
And spied her not; for none of all his men
Dare tell him Dora waited with the child;
And Dora would have risen and gone to him,
But her heart fail�d her; and the reapers reap�d,
And the sun fell, and all the land was dark.
But when the morrow came, she rose and took
The child once more, and sat upon the mound;
And made a little wreath of all the flowers
That grew about, and tied it round his hat
To make him pleasing in her uncle�s eye.
Then when the farmer pass�d into the field
He spied her, and he left his men at work,
And came and said: �Where were you yesterday?
Whose child is that? What are you doing here?�
So Dora cast her eyes upon the ground,
And answer�d softly, �This is William�s child!�
�And did I not,� said Allan, �did I not
Forbid you, Dora?� Dora said again
�Do with me as you will, but take the child,
And bless him for the sake of him that�s gone!�
And Allan said, �I see it is a trick
Got up betwixt you and the woman there.
I must be taught my duty, and by you!
You knew my word was law, and yet you dared
To slight it. Well�for I will take the boy;
But go you hence, and never see me more.�
So saying, he took the boy that cried aloud
And struggled hard. The wreath of flowers fell
At Dora�s feet. She bow�d upon her hands,
And the boy�s cry came to her from the field,
More and more distant. She bow�d down her head,
Remembering the clay when first shecame,
And all the things that had been. She how�d down
And wept in secret; and the reapers reap�d,
And the sun fell, and all the land was dark.
Then Dora went to Mary�s house, and stood
Upon the threshold. Mary saw the boy
Was not with Dora. She broke out in praise
To God, that help�d her in her widowhood.
And Dora said, �My uncle took the boy
But, Mary, let me live and work with you
He says that he will never see me more.�
Then answer�d Mary, �This shall never be,
That thou shouldst take my trouble on thyself
And, now I think, he shall not have the boy,
For he will teach him hardness, and to slight
His mother; therefore thou and I will go,
And I will have my boy, and bring him home;
And I will beg of him to take thee back
But if he will not take thee back again,
Then thou and I will live within one house,
And work for William�s child, until he grows
Of age to help us.�
So the women kiss�d
Each other, and set out, and reach�d the farm.
The door was off the latch: they peep�d, and saw
The boy set up betwixt his grandsire�s knees,
Who thrust him in the hollows of his arm,
And clapt him on the hands and on the cheeks,
Like one that loved him: and the lad stretch�d out
And babbled for the golden seal, that hung
From Allan�s watch, and sparkled by the fire.
Then they came in: but when the boy beheld
His mother, he cried out to come to her
And Allan set him down, and Mary said
�O Father!�if you let me call you so�
I never carne a-begging for myself,
Or William, or this child; but now I come
For Dora: take her hack; she loves you well.
O Sir, when William died, he died at peace
With all men; for I ask�d him, and he said,
He could not ever rue his marrying me�
I had been a patient wife: but, Sir, he said
That he was wrong to cross his father thus
�God bless him!� he said, �and may he never know
The troubles I have gone thro�!� Then he turn�d
His face and pass�d�unhappy that I am!
But now, Sir, let me have my boy, for you
Will make him hard, and he will learn to slight
His father�s memory; and take Dora back,
And let all this be as it was before.�
So Mary said, and Dora hid her face
By Mary. There was silence in the room;
And all at once the old man burst in sobs:�
I have been to blame�to blame. I have kill�d my son.
I have kill�d him�but I loved him�my dear son.
May God forgive me!�I have been to blame.
Kiss me, my children.�
Then they clung about
The old man�s neck, and kiss�d him many times.
And all the man was broken with remorse;
And all his love came back a hundred-fold;
And for three hours he sobb�d o�er Wiliam�s child
Thinking of William.
So those four abode
Within one house together; and as years
Went forward, Mary took another mate;
But Dora lived unmarried till her death.
