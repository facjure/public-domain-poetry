 I saw sweet Poetry turn troubled eyes
On shaggy Science nosing in the grass,
For by that way poor Poetry must pass
 On her long pilgrimage to Paradise.
 He snuffled, grunted, squealed; perplexed by flies,
Parched, weatherworn, and near of sight, alas,
From peering close where very little was
 In dens secluded from the open skies.

 But Poetry in bravery went down,
And called his name, soft, clear, and fearlessly;
 Stooped low, and stroked his muzzle overgrown;
 Refreshed his drought with dew; wiped pure and free
His eyes: and lo! laughed loud for joy to see
 In those grey deeps the azure of her own.
