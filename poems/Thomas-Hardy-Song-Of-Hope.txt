title: Song Of Hope
---

O sweet To-morrow! -
 After to-day
 There will away
This sense of sorrow.
Then let us borrow
Hope, for a gleaming
Soon will be streaming,
 Dimmed by no gray -
 No gray!

While the winds wing us
 Sighs from The Gone,
 Nearer to dawn
Minute-beats bring us;
When there will sing us
Larks of a glory
Waiting our story
 Further anon -
 Anon!

Doff the black token,
 Don the red shoon,
 Right and retune
Viol-strings broken;
Null the words spoken
In speeches of rueing,
The night cloud is hueing,
 To-morrow shines soon -
 Shines soon!
