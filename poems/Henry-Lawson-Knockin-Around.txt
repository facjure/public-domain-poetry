title: Knockin' Around
---

Weary old wife, with the bucket and cow,
�How�s your son Jack? and where is he now?�
Haggard old eyes that turn to the west,
�Boys will be boys, and he�s gone with the rest!�
Grief without tears and grief without sound;
�Somewhere up-country he�s knocking around.�
Knocking around with a vagabond crew,
Does for himself what a mother would do;
Maybe in trouble and maybe hard-up,
Maybe in want of a bite or a sup;
Dead of the fever, or lost in the drought,
Lonely old mother! he�s knocking about.

Wiry old man at the tail of the plough,
�Heard of Jack lately? and where is he now?�
Pauses a moment his forehead to wipe,
Drops the rope reins while he feels for his pipe,
Scratches his grey head in sorrow or doubt:
�Somewheers or others he�s knocking about.�

Knocking about on the runs of the West,
Holding his own with the worst and the best
Breaking in horses and risking his neck,
Droving or shearing and making a cheque;
Straight as a sapling,six-foot and sound,
Jack is all right when he�s knocking around
