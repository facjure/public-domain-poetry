---

 Scattering, like birds escaped the fowler's net,
 Some seek with timely flight a foreign strand;
 Most happy, re-assembled in a land
 By dauntless Luther freed, could they forget
 Their Country's woes. But scarcely have they met,
 Partners in faith, and brothers in distress,
 Free to pour forth their common thankfulness,
 Ere hope declines: their union is beset
 With speculative notions rashly sown,
 Whence thickly-sprouting growth of poisonous weeds;
 Their forms are broken staves; their passions, steeds
 That master them. How enviably blest
 Is he who can, by help of grace, enthrone
 The peace of God within his single breast!
