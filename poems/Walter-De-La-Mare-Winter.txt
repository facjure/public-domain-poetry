 Green Mistletoe!
 Oh, I remember now
 A dell of snow,
 Frost on the bough;
 None there but I:
 Snow, snow, and a wintry sky.

 None there but I,
 And footprints one by one,
 Zigzaggedly,
 Where I had run;
 Where shrill and powdery
 A robin sat in the tree.

 And he whistled sweet;
 And I in the crusted snow
 With snow-clubbed feet
 Jigged to and fro,
 Till, from the day,
 The rose-light ebbed away.

 And the robin flew
 Into the air, the air,
 The white mist through;
 And small and rare
 The night-frost fell
 In the calm and misty dell.

 And the dusk gathered low,
 And the silver moon and stars
 On the frozen snow
 Drew taper bars,
 Kindled winking fires
 In the hooded briers.

 And the sprawling Bear
 Growled deep in the sky;
 And Orion's hair
 Streamed sparkling by:
 But the North sighed low,
 "Snow, snow, more snow!"
