title: Sonnets Upon The Punishment Of Death - In Series, 1839 - XI - Ah, Think How One Compelled For Life To Abide
---

 Ah, think how one compelled for life to abide
 Locked in a dungeon needs must eat the heart
 Out of his own humanity, and part
 With every hope that mutual cares provide;
 And, should a less unnatural doom confide
 In life-long exile on a savage coast,
 Soon the relapsing penitent may boast
 Of yet more heinous guilt, with fiercer pride.
 Hence thoughtful Mercy, Mercy sage and pure,
 Sanctions the forfeiture that Law demands,
 Leaving the final issue in 'His' hands
 Whose goodness knows no change, whose love is sure,
 Who sees, foresees; who cannot judge amiss,
 And wafts at will the contrite soul to bliss.
