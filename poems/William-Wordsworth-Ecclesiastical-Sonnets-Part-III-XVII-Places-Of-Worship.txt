 As star that shines dependent upon star
 Is to the sky while we look up and love;
 As to the deep fair ships which though they move
 Seem fixed, to eyes that watch them from afar;
 As to the sandy desert fountains are,
 With palm-groves shaded at wide intervals,
 Whose fruit around the sun-burnt Native falls
 Of roving tired or desultory war
 Such to this British Isle her Christian Fanes,
 Each linked to each for kindred services;
 Her Spires, her Steeple-towers with glittering vanes
 Far-kenned, her Chapels lurking among trees,
 Where a few villagers on bended knees
 Find solace which a busy world disdains.
