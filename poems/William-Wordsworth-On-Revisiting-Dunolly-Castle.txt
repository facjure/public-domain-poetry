title: On Revisiting Dunolly Castle
---

 The captive Bird was gone; to cliff or moor
 Perchance had flown, delivered by the storm;
 Or he had pined, and sunk to feed the worm:
 Him found we not: but, climbing, a tall tower,
 There saw, impaved with rude fidelity
 Of art mosaic, in a roofless floor,
 An Eagle with stretched wings, but beamless eye
 An Eagle that could neither wail nor soar.
 Effigy of the Vanished, (shall I dare
 To call thee so?) or symbol of fierce deeds
 And of the towering courage which past times
 Rejoiced in-take, whate'er thou be, a share,
 Not undeserved, of the memorial rhymes
 That animate my way where'er it leads!
