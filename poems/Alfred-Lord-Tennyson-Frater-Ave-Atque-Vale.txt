�Frater Ave atque Vale�
 
Row us out from Desenzano, to your Sirmione row!
So they row�d, and there we landed��O venusta Sirmio!�
There to me thro� all the groves of olive in the summer glow,
There beneath the Roman ruin where the purple flowers grow,
Came that �Ave atque Vale� of the Poet�s hopeless woe,
Tenderest of Roman poets nineteen-hundred years ago,
�Frater Ave atque Vale��as we wander�d to and fro
Gazing at the Lydian laughter of the Garda Lake below
Sweet Catullus's all-but-island, olive-silvery Sirmio!
