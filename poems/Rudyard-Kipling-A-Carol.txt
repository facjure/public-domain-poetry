Our Lord Who did the Ox command
 To kneel to Judah's King,
He binds His frost upon the land
 To ripen it for Spring,
To ripen it for Spring, good sirs,
 According to His Word.
Which well must be as ye can see,
 And who shall judge the Lord?

When we poor fenmen skate the ice
 Or shiver on the wold,
We hear the cry of a single tree
 That breaks her heart in the cold,
That breaks her heart in the cold, good sirs,
 And rendeth by the board.
Which well must be as ye can see,
 And who shall judge the Lord?

Her wood is crazed and little worth
 Excepting as to burn,
That we may warm and make our mirth
 Until the Spring return,
Until the Spring return, good sirs,
 When Christians walk abroad;
When well must be as ye can see,
 And who shall judge the Lord?

God bless the master of this house,
 And all who sleep therein!
And guard the fens from pirate folk,
 And keep us all from sin,
To walk in honesty, good sirs,
 Of thought and deed and word!
Which shall befriend our latter end....
 And who shall judge the Lord?
