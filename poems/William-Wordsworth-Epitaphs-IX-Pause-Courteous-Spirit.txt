title: Epitaphs IX. Pause, Courteous Spirit
---

 Pause, courteous Spirit! Balbi supplicates
 That Thou, with no reluctant voice, for him
 Here laid in mortal darkness, wouldst prefer
 A prayer to the Redeemer of the world.
 This to the dead by sacred right belongs;
 All else is nothing. Did occasion suit
 To tell his worth, the marble of this tomb
 Would ill suffice: for Plato's lore sublime,
 And all the wisdom of the Stagyrite,
 Enriched and beautified his studious mind:
 With Archimedes also he conversed
 As with a chosen friend, nor did he leave
 Those laureat wreaths ungathered which the Nymphs
 Twine near their loved Permessus. Finally,
 Himself above each lower thought uplifting,
 His ears he closed to listen to the songs
 Which Sion's Kings did consecrate of old;
 And his Permessus found on Lebanon.
 A blessed Man! who of protracted days
 Made not, as thousands do, a vulgar sleep;
 But truly did 'He' live his life. Urbino,
 Take pride in him! O Passenger, farewell!
