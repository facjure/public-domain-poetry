title: How Rich That Forehead's Calm Expanse
---

 How rich that forehead's calm expanse!
 How bright that heaven-directed glance!
 Waft her to glory, winged Powers,
 Ere sorrow be renewed,
 And intercourse with mortal hours
 Bring back a humbler mood!
 So looked Cecilia when she drew
 An Angel from his station;
 So looked; not ceasing to pursue
 Her tuneful adoration!
 But hand and voice alike are still;
 No sound 'here' sweeps away the will
 That gave it birth: in service meek
 One upright arm sustains the cheek,
 And one across the bosom lies
 That rose, and now forgets to rise,
 Subdued by breathless harmonies
 Of meditative feeling;
 Mute strains from worlds beyond the skies,
 Through the pure light of female eyes,
 Their sanctity revealing!
