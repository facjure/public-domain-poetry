 "Whom seek you here, sweet Mistress Fell?"
 "One who loved me passing well.
 Dark his eye, wild his face - 
 Stranger, if in this lonely place
 Bide such an one, then, prythee, say
 I am come here to-day."

 "Many his like, Mistress Fell?"
 "I did not look, so cannot tell.
 Only this I surely know,
 When his voice called me, I must go;
 Touched me his fingers, and my heart
 Leapt at the sweet pain's smart."

 "Why did he leave you, Mistress Fell?"
 "Magic laid its dreary spell. - 
 Stranger, he was fast asleep;
 Into his dream I tried to creep;
 Called his name, soft was my cry;
 He answered - not one sigh.

 "The flower and the thorn are here;
 Falleth the night-dew, cold and clear;
 Out of her bower the bird replies,
 Mocking the dark with ecstasies,
 See how the earth's green grass doth grow,
 Praising what sleeps below!

 "Thus have they told me. And I come,
 As flies the wounded wild-bird home.
 Not tears I give; but all that he
 Clasped in his arms, sweet charity;
 All that he loved - to him I bring
 For a close whispering."
