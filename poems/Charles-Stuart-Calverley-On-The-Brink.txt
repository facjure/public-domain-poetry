I watch'd her as she stoop'd to pluck
 A wildflower in her hair to twine;
And wish'd that it had been my luck
 To call her mine.

Anon I heard her rate with mad
 Mad words her babe within its cot;
And felt particularly glad
 That it had not.

I knew (such subtle brains have men)
 That she was uttering what she shouldn't;
And thought that I would chide, and then
 I thought I wouldn't:

Who could have gazed upon that face,
 Those pouting coral lips, and chided?
A Rhadamanthus, in my place,
 Had done as I did:

For ire wherewith our bosoms glow
 Is chain'd there oft by Beauty's spell;
And, more than that, I did not know
 The widow well.

So the harsh phrase pass'd unreproved.
 Still mute - (O brothers, was it sin?) -
I drank, unutterably moved,
 Her beauty in:

And to myself I murmur'd low,
 As on her upturn'd face and dress
The moonlight fell, "Would she say No,
 By chance, or Yes?"

She stood so calm, so like a ghost
 Betwixt me and that magic moon,
That I already was almost
 A finish'd coon.

But when she caught adroitly up
 And soothed with smiles her little daughter;
And gave it, if I'm right, a sup
 Of barley-water;

And, crooning still the strange sweet lore
 Which only mothers' tongues can utter,
Snow'd with deft hand the sugar o'er
 Its bread and butter;

And kiss'd it clingingly - (Ah, why
 Don't women do these things in private?) -
I felt that if I lost her, I
 Should not survive it:

And from my mouth the words nigh flew -
 The past, the future, I forgat 'em:
"Oh! if you'd kiss me as you do
 That thankless atom!"

But this thought came ere yet I spake,
 And froze the sentence on my lips:
"They err, who marry wives that make
 Those little slips."

It came like some familiar rhyme,
 Some copy to my boyhood set;
And that's perhaps the reason I'm
 Unmarried yet.

Would she have own'd how pleased she was,
 And told her love with widow's pride?
I never found out that, because
 I never tried.

Be kind to babes and beasts and birds:
 Hearts may be hard, though lips are coral;
And angry words are angry words:
 And that's the moral.
