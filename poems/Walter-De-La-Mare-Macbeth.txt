 Rose, like dim battlements, the hills and reared
 Steep crags into the fading primrose sky;
 But in the desolate valleys fell small rain,
 Mingled with drifting cloud. I saw one come,
 Like the fierce passion of that vacant place,
 His face turned glittering to the evening sky;
 His eyes, like grey despair, fixed satelessly
 On the still, rainy turrets of the storm;
 And all his armour in a haze of blue.
 He held no sword, bare was his hand and clenched,
 As if to hide the inextinguishable blood
 Murder had painted there. And his wild mouth
 Seemed spouting echoes of deluded thoughts.
 Around his head, like vipers all distort,
 His locks shook, heavy-laden, at each stride.
 If fire may burn invisible to the eye;
 O, if despair strive everlastingly;
 Then haunted here the creature of despair,
 Fanning and fanning flame to lick upon
 A soul still childish in a blackened hell.
