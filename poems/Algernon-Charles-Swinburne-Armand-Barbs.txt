I

Fire out of heaven, a flower of perfect fire,
That where the roots of life are had its root
And where the fruits of time are brought forth fruit;
A faith made flesh, a visible desire,
That heard the yet unbreathing years respire
And speech break forth of centuries that sit mute
Beyond all feebler footprint of pursuit;
That touched the highest of hope, and went up higher;
A heart love-wounded whereto love was law,
A soul reproachless without fear or flaw,
A shining spirit without shadow of shame,
A memory made of all men�s love and awe;
Being disembodied, so thou be the same,
What need, O soul, to sign thee with thy name?



II

All woes of all men sat upon thy soul
And all their wrongs were heavy on thy head;
With all their wounds thy heart was pierced and bled,
And in thy spirit as in a mourning scroll
The world�s huge sorrows were inscribed by roll,
All theirs on earth who serve and faint for bread,
All banished men�s, all theirs in prison dead,
Thy love had heart and sword-hand for the whole.
�This was my day of glory,� didst thou say,
When, by the scaffold thou hadst hope to climb
For thy faith�s sake, they brought thee respite; �Nay,
I shall not die then, I have missed my day.�
O hero, O our help, O head sublime,
Thy day shall be commensurate with time.
