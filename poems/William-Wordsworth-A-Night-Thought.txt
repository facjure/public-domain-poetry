title: A Night Thought

 Lo! where the Moon along the sky
 Sails with her happy destiny;
 Oft is she hid from mortal eye
 Or dimly seen,
 But when the clouds asunder fly
 How bright her mien!

 Far different we, a froward race,
 Thousands though rich in Fortune's grace
 With cherished sullenness of pace
 Their way pursue,
 Ingrates who wear a smileless face
 The whole year through.

 If kindred humours e'er would make
 My spirit droop for drooping's sake,
 From Fancy following in thy wake,
 Bright ship of heaven!
 A counter impulse let me take
 And be forgiven.
