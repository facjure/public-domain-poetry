title: Memory And I
---

"O memory, where is now my youth,
Who used to say that life was truth?"

"I saw him in a crumbled cot
 Beneath a tottering tree;
That he as phantom lingers there
 Is only known to me."

"O Memory, where is now my joy,
Who lived with me in sweet employ?"

"I saw him in gaunt gardens lone,
 Where laughter used to be;
That he as phantom wanders there
 Is known to none but me."

"O Memory, where is now my hope,
Who charged with deeds my skill and scope?"

"I saw her in a tomb of tomes,
 Where dreams are wont to be;
That she as spectre haunteth there
 Is only known to me."

"O Memory, where is now my faith,
One time a champion, now a wraith?"

"I saw her in a ravaged aisle,
 Bowed down on bended knee;
That her poor ghost outflickers there
 Is known to none but me."

"O Memory, where is now my love,
That rayed me as a god above?"

"I saw him by an ageing shape
 Where beauty used to be;
That his fond phantom lingers there
 Is only known to me."
