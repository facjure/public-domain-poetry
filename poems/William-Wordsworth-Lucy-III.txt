---

I travell�d among unknown men,
In lands beyond the sea;
Nor, England! did I know till then
What love I bore to thee.

�Tis past, that melancholy dream!
Nor will I quit thy shore
A second time; for still I seem
To love thee more and more.

Among thy mountains did I feel
The joy of my desire;
And she I cherish�d turn�d her wheel
Beside an English fire.

Thy mornings showed, thy nights conceal�d,
The bowers where Lucy played;
And thine too is the last green field
That Lucy�s eyes survey�d.
