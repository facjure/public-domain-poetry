Midsummer midnight skies,
Midsummer midnight influences and airs,
The shining sensitive silver of the sea
Touched with the strange-hued blazonings of dawn:
And all so solemnly still I seem to hear
The breathing of Life and Death,
The secular Accomplices,
Renewing the visible miracle of the world.

The wistful stars
Shine like good memories.The young morning wind
Blows full of unforgotten hours
As over a region of roses.Life and Death
Sound on, sound on. . . . And the night magical,
Troubled yet comforting, thrills
As if the Enchanted Castle at the heart
Of the wood's dark wonderment
Swung wide his valves and filled the dim sea-banks
With exquisite visitants:
Words fiery-hearted yet, dreams and desires
With living looks intolerable, regrets
Whose voice comes as the voice of an only child
Heard from the grave: shapes of a Might-Have-Been,
Beautiful, miserable, distraught,
The Law no man may baffle denied and slew.

The spell-bound ships stand as at gaze
To let the marvel by.The grey road glooms . . .
Glimmers . . . goes out . . . and there, O there where it fades,
What grace, what glamour, what wild will,
Transfigure the shadows?Whose,
Heart of my heart, Soul of my soul, but yours?

Ghosts, ghosts, the sapphirine air
Teems with them even to the gleaming ends
Of the wild day-spring!Ghosts,
Everywhere, everywhere, till I and you
At last, dear love, at last!
Are in the dreaming, even as Life and Death,
Twin-ministers of the unoriginal Will.
