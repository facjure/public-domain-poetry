Region of damper and junk and tea,
Region of pastures wide!
The fairest spots in the world to me
Are out on the Lachlan Side.

CHORUS:
 I�m off to the Lachlan Side,
Where the bright lagoons are wide;
I long for river and grass and tree,
And someone dearer than all to me,
Far out on the Lachlan Side.

My heart was hardened against advice
And reason I would not see,
For by the ocean a paradise
The city appeared to me.

CHORUS:
I�m off to the Lachlan Side, etc.

�Not I for a bumpkin�s fate,� I cried,
�I�ll not be a country clown!
A life�s too slow on the Lachlan Side;
I�ll go to the shining town!�

CHORUS:
I�m off to the Lachlan Side, etc.

I�ve lost the battle, I strike the flag,
The town may sink in the tide;
A wiser head and a lighter swag
I take to the Lachlan Side.

CHORUS:
I�m off to the Lachlan Side, etc.

When crops of wool on the plains shall grow,
Shall flourish in drought or rain,
And when the shearers begin to mow
I�ll come to the town again.

CHORUS:
I�m off to the Lachlan Side, etc.

But now I go to a kinder fate,
If her love still conquers pride;
Her heart was true when she sobbed, �I�ll wait
For you on the Lachlan Side.�

CHORUS:
 I�m off to the Lachlan Side,
Where the bright lagoons are wide;
I long for river and grass and tree,
And someone dearer than all to me,
Far out on the Lachlan Side.
