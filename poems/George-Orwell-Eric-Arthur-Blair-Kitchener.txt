No stone is set to mark his nation�s loss,
No stately tomb enshrines his noble breast;
Not e�en the tribute of a wooden cross
Can mark this hero�s rest.

He needs them not, his name untarnished stands,
Remindful of the mighty deeds he worked,
Footprints of one, upon time�s changeful sands,
Who ne�er his duty shirked.

Who follows in his steps no danger shuns,
Nor stoops to conquer by a shameful deed,
An honest and unselfish race he runs,
From fear and malice freed.
