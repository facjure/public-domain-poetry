 From early youth I ploughed the restless Main,
 My mind as restless and as apt to change;
 Through every clime and ocean did I range,
 In hope at length a competence to gain;
 For poor to Sea I went, and poor I still remain.
 Year after year I strove, but strove in vain,
 And hardships manifold did I endure,
 For Fortune on me never deigned to smile;
 Yet I at last a resting-place have found,
 With just enough life's comforts to procure,
 In a snug Cove on this our favoured Isle,
 A peaceful spot where Nature's gifts abound;
 Then sure I have no reason to complain,
 Though poor to Sea I went, and poor I still remain.
