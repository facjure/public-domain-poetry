On the Track of Grand Endeavour, on the long track out to Bourke,
Past the Turn-Back, and past Howlong, and the pub at Sudden Jerk,
Past old Bullock-Yoke and Bog Flat, and the �Pinch� at Stick-to-me,
Lies the camp that we have christened, christened �Broken Axletree.�

We were young and strong and fearless, we had not seen Mount Despair,
And the West was to be conquered, and we meant to do our share;
We were far away from cities, and were fairly off the spree
When we camped at Cart Wheel River with a broken axletree.

Oh, the pub at Devil�s Crossing! and the woman that he sent!
And the hell for which we bartered horse and trap and �traps� and tent!
And the black �Since Then�, the chances that we never more may see, 
Ah! the two lives that were ruined for a broken axletree!

�Fate� is but a Cart Wheel River, placed to test us by the Lord,
And the Star of Live Forever shines beyond At Blacksmith�s Ford!
Shun all fatalists and �isms�, heed no talk of �destiny�!
Ride a race for life to Blacksmith�s with your broken axletree.
