 Among the mountains were we nursed, loved Stream
 Thou near the eagle's nest, within brief sail,
 I, of his bold wing floating on the gale,
 Where thy deep voice could lull me! Faint the beam
 Of human life when first allowed to gleam
 On mortal notice. Glory of the vale,
 Such thy meek outset, with a crown, though frail,
 Kept in perpetual verdure by the steam
 Of thy soft breath! Less vivid wreath entwined
 Nemaean victor's brow; less bright was worn,
 Meed of some Roman chief, in triumph borne
 With captives chained; and shedding from his car
 The sunset splendours of a finished war
 Upon the proud enslavers of mankind!
