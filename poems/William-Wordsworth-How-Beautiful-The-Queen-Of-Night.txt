title: How Beautiful The Queen Of Night
---

 How beautiful the Queen of Night, on high
 Her way pursuing among scattered clouds,
 Where, ever and anon, her head she shrouds
 Hidden from view in dense obscurity.
 But look, and to the watchful eye
 A brightening edge will indicate that soon
 We shall behold the struggling Moon
 Break forth, again to walk the clear blue sky.
