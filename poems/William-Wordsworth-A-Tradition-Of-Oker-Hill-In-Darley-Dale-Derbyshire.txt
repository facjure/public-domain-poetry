title: A Tradition Of Oker Hill In Darley Dale, Derbyshire
---

 'Tis said that to the brow of yon fair hill
 Two Brothers clomb, and, turning face from face,
 Nor one look more exchanging, grief to still
 Or feed, each planted on that lofty place
 A chosen Tree; then, eager to fullfil
 Their courses, like two new-born rivers, they
 In opposite directions urged their way
 Down from the far-seen mount. No blast might kill
 Or blight that fond memorial; the trees grew,
 And now entwine their arms; but ne'er again
 Embraced those Brothers upon earth's wide plain;
 Nor aught of mutual joy or sorrow knew
 Until their spirits mingled in the sea
 That to itself takes all, Eternity.
