My mother dandled me and sang,
�How young it is, how young!�
And made a golden cradle
That on a willow swung.

�He went away,� my mother sang,
�When I was brought to bed,�
And all the while her needle pulled
The gold and silver thread.

She pulled the thread and bit the thread
And made a golden gown,
And wept because she had dreamt that I
Was born to wear a crown.

�When she was got,� my mother sang,
�I heard a sea-mew cry,
And saw a flake of the yellow foam
That dropped upon my thigh.�

How therefore could she help but braid
The gold into my hair,
And dream that I should carry
The golden top of care?
