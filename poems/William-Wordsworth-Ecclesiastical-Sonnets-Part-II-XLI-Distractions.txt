title: Ecclesiastical Sonnets - Part II. - XLI - Distractions
---

 Men, who have ceased to reverence, soon defy,
 Their forefathers; lo! sects are formed, and split
 With morbid restlessness; the ecstatic fit
 Spreads wide; though special mysteries multiply,
 'The Saints must govern', is their common cry;
 And so they labour, deeming Holy Writ
 Disgraced by aught that seems content to sit
 Beneath the roof of settled Modesty.
 The Romanist exults; fresh hope he draws
 From the confusion, craftily incites
 The overweening, personates the mad
 To heap disgust upon the worthier Cause:
 Totters the Throne; the new-born Church is sad,
 For every wave against her peace unites.
