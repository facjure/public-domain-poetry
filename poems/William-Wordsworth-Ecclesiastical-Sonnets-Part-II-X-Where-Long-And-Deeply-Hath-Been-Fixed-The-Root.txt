title: Ecclesiastical Sonnets - Part II. - X - Where Long And Deeply Hath Been Fixed The Root
---

 Where long and deeply hath been fixed the root
 In the blest soil of gospel truth, the Tree,
 (Blighted or scathed tho' many branches be,
 Put forth to wither, many a hopeful shoot)
 Can never cease to bear celestial fruit.
 Witness the Church that oft-times, with effect
 Dear to the saints, strives earnestly to eject
 Her bane, her vital energies recruit.
 Lamenting, do not hopelessly repine,
 When such good work is doomed to be undone,
 The conquests lost that were so hardly won:
 All promises vouchsafed by Heaven will shine
 In light confirmed while years their course shall run,
 Confirmed alike in progress and decline.
