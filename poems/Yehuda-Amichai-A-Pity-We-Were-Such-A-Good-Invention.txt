title: A Pity, We Were Such A Good Invention
---

They amputated
Your thighs off my hips.
As far as I'm concerned
They are all surgeons.All of them.

They dismantled us
Each from the other.
As far as I'm concerned
They are all engineers.All of them.

A pity.We were such a good
And loving invention.
An aeroplane made from a man and wife.
Wings and everything.
We hovered a little above the earth.

We even flew a little.
