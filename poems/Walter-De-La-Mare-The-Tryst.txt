 Flee into some forgotten night and be
 Of all dark long my moon-bright company:
 Beyond the rumour even of Paradise come,
 There, out of all remembrance, make our home:
 Seek we some close hid shadow for our lair,
 Hollowed by Noah's mouse beneath the chair
 Wherein the Omnipotent, in slumber bound,
 Nods till the piteous Trump of Judgment sound.
 Perchance Leviathan of the deep sea
 Would lease a lost mermaiden's grot to me,
 There of your beauty we would joyance make - 
 A music wistful for the sea-nymph's sake:
 Haply Elijah, o'er his spokes of fire,
 Cresting steep Leo, or the heavenly Lyre,
 Spied, tranced in azure of inanest space,
 Some eyrie hostel, meet for human grace,
 Where two might happy be - just you and I - 
 Lost in the uttermost of Eternity.
 Think! In Time's smallest clock's minutest beat
 Might there not rest be found for wandering feet?
 Or, 'twixt the sleep and wake of Helen's dream,
 Silence wherein to sing love's requiem?
 No, no. Nor earth, nor air, nor fire, nor deep
 Could lull poor mortal longingness asleep.
 Somewhere there Nothing is; and there lost Man
 Shall win what changeless vague of peace he can.
