title: Ballad Of Earl Haldan's Daughter
---

 It was Earl Haldan's daughter,
 She looked across the sea;
 She looked across the water;
 And long and loud laughed she:
 'The locks of six princesses
 Must be my marriage fee,
So hey bonny boat, and ho bonny boat!
 Who comes a wooing me?'

 It was Earl Haldan's daughter,
 She walked along the sand;
 When she was aware of a knight so fair,
 Came sailing to the land.
 His sails were all of velvet,
 His mast of beaten gold,
And 'Hey bonny boat, and ho bonny boat!
 Who saileth here so bold?'

 'The locks of five princesses
 I won beyond the sea;
 I clipt their golden tresses,
 To fringe a cloak for thee.
 One handful yet is wanting,
 But one of all the tale;
So hey bonny boat, and ho bonny boat!
 Furl up thy velvet sail!'

 He leapt into the water,
 That rover young and bold;
 He gript Earl Haldan's daughter,
 He clipt her locks of gold:
 'Go weep, go weep, proud maiden,
 The tale is full to-day.
Now hey bonny boat, and ho bonny boat!
 Sail Westward ho! away!'

Devonshire, 1854
 From Westward Ho!
