title: King and No King
---

�Would it were anything but merely voice!�
The No King cried who after that was King,
Because he had not heard of anything
That balanced with a word is more than noise;
Yet Old Romance being kind, let him prevail
Somewhere or somehow that I have forgot,
Though he�d but cannon, Whereas we that had thought
To have lit upon as clean and sweet a tale
Have been defeated by that pledge you gave
In momentary anger long ago;
And I that have not your faith, how shall I know
That in the blinding light beyond the grave
We�ll find so good a thing as that we have lost?
The hourly kindness, the day�s common speech,
The habitual content of each with each
When neither soul nor body has been crossed.
