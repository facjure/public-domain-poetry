title: All Roads That Lead To God Are Good
---

All roads that lead to God are good.
 What matters it, your faith, or mine?
 Both centre at the goal divine
Of love's eternal Brotherhood.

The kindly life in house or street - 
 The life of prayer and mystic rite - 
 The student's search for truth and light - 
These paths at one great Junction meet.

Before the oldest book was writ,
 Full many a prehistoric soul
 Arrived at this unchanging goal,
Through changeless Love, that leads to it.

What matters that one found his Christ
 In rising sun, or burning fire?
 If faith within him did not tire,
His longing for the Truth sufficed.

Before our modern hell was brought
 To edify the modern world,
 Full many a hate-filled soul was hurled
In lakes of fire by its own thought.

A thousand creeds have come and gone,
 But what is that to you or me?
 Creeds are but branches of a tree - 
The root of love lives on and on.

Though branch by branch proves withered wood,
 The root is warm with precious wine.
 Then keep your faith and leave me mine - 
All roads that lead to God are good.
