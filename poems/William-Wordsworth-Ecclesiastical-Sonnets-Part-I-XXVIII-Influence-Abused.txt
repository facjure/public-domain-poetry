 Urged by Ambition, who with subtlest skill
 Changes her means, the Enthusiast as a dupe
 Shall soar, and as a hypocrite can stoop,
 And turn the instruments of good to ill,
 Moulding the credulous people to his will.
 Such Dunstan: from its Benedictine coop
 Issues the master Mind, at whose fell swoop
 The chaste affections tremble to fulfil
 Their purposes. Behold, pre-signified,
 The Might of spiritual sway! his thoughts, his dreams,
 Do in the supernatural world abide:
 So vaunt a throng of Followers, filled with pride
 In what they see of virtues pushed to extremes,
 And sorceries of talent misapplied.
