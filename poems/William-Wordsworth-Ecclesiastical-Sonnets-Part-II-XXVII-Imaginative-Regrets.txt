 Deep is the lamentation! Not alone
 From Sages justly honoured by mankind;
 But from the ghostly tenants of the wind,
 Demons and Spirits, many a dolorous groan
 Issues for that dominion overthrown:
 Proud Tiber grieves, and far-off Ganges, blind
 As his own worshipers: and Nile, reclined
 Upon his monstrous urn, the farewell moan
 Renews. Through every forest, cave, and den,
 Where frauds were hatched of old, hath sorrow past
 Hangs o'er the Arabian Prophet's native Waste,
 Where once his airy helpers schemed and planned
 'Mid spectral lakes bemocking thirsty men,
 And stalking pillars built of fiery sand.
