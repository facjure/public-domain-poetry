 People that build their houses inland,
 People that buy a plot of ground
 Shaped like a house, and build a house there,
 Far from the sea-board, far from the sound

 Of water sucking the hollow ledges,
 Tons of water striking the shore,--
 What do they long for, as I long for
 One salt smell of the sea once more?

 People the waves have not awakened,
 Spanking the boats at the harbor's head,
 What do they long for, as I long for,--
 Starting up in my inland bed,

 Beating the narrow walls, and finding
 Neither a window nor a door,
 Screaming to God for death by drowning,--
 One salt taste of the sea once more?
