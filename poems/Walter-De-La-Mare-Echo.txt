 "Who called?" I said, and the words
Through the whispering glades,
 Hither, thither, baffled the birds - 
"Who called? Who called?"

 The leafy boughs on high
Hissed in the sun;
 The dark air carried my cry
Faintingly on:

 Eyes in the green, in the shade,
In the motionless brake,
 Voices that said what I said,
For mockery's sake:

 "Who cares?" I bawled through my tears;
The wind fell low:
 In the silence, "Who cares? who cares?"
Wailed to and fro.
