 She will not die, they say,
 She will but put her beauty by
 And hie away.

 Oh, but her beauty gone, how lonely
 Then will seem all reverie,
 How black to me!

 All things will sad be made
 And every hope a memory,
 All gladness dead.

 Ghosts of the past will know
 My weakest hour, and whisper to me,
 And coldly go.

 And hers in deep of sleep,
 Clothed in its mortal beauty I shall see,
 And, waking, weep.

 Naught will my mind then find
 In man's false Heaven my peace to be:
 All blind, and blind.
