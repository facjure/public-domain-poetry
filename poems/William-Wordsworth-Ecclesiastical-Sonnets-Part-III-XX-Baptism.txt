 Dear be the Church, that, watching o'er the needs
 Of Infancy, provides a timely shower
 Whose virtue changes to a Christian Flower
 A Growth from sinful Nature's bed of weeds!
 Fitliest beneath the sacred roof proceeds
 The ministration; while parental Love
 Looks on, and Grace descendeth from above
 As the high service pledges now, now pleads.
 There, should vain thoughts outspread their wings and fly
 To meet the coming hours of festal mirth,
 The tombs which hear and answer that brief cry,
 The Infant's notice of his second birth
 Recall the wandering Soul to sympathy
 With what man hopes from Heaven, yet fears from Earth.
