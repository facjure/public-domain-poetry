title: Sonnets Upon The Punishment Of Death - In Series, 1839 - XII - See The Condemned Alone Within His Cell
---

 See the Condemned alone within his cell
 And prostrate at some moment when remorse
 Stings to the quick, and, with resistless force,
 Assaults the pride she strove in vain to quell.
 Then mark him, him who could so long rebel,
 The crime confessed, a kneeling Penitent
 Before the Altar, where the Sacrament
 Softens his heart, till from his eyes outwell
 Tears of salvation. Welcome death! while Heaven
 Does in this change exceedingly rejoice;
 While yet the solemn heed the State hath given
 Helps him to meet the last Tribunal's voice
 In faith, which fresh offenses, were he cast
 On old temptations, might for ever blast.
