 I think that the bitterest sorrow or pain
 Of love unrequited, or cold death's woe,
 Is sweet compared to that hour when we know
 That some grand passion is on the wane;

 When we see that the glory and glow and grace
 Which lent a splendor to night and day
 Are surely fading, and showing the gray
 And dull groundwork of the commonplace;

 When fond expressions on dull ears fall,
 When the hands clasp calmly without one thrill,
 When we cannot muster by force of will
 The old emotions that came at call;

 When the dream has vanished we fain would keep,
 When the heart, like a watch, runs out of gear,
 And all the savor goes out of the year,
 Oh, then is the time - if we can - to weep!

 But no tears soften this dull, pale woe;
 We must sit and face it with dry, sad eyes.
 If we seek to hold it, the swifter joy flies - 
 We can only be passive, and let it go.
