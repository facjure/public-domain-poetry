 How sad a welcome! To each voyager
 Some ragged child holds up for sale a store
 Of wave-worn pebbles, pleading on the shore
 Where once came monk and nun with gentle stir,
 Blessings to give, news ask, or suit prefer.
 Yet is yon neat trim church a grateful speck
 Of novelty amid the sacred wreck
 Strewn far and wide. Think, proud Philosopher!
 Fallen though she be, this Glory of the west,
 Still on her sons, the beams of mercy shine;
 And "hopes, perhaps more heavenly bright than thine,
 A grace by thee unsought and unpossest,
 A faith more fixed, a rapture more divine,
 Shall gild their passage to eternal rest."
