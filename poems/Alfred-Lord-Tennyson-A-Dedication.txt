title: A Dedication
---

DEAR, near and true�no truer Time himself
Can prove you, tho� he make you evermore
Dearer and nearer, as the rapid of life
Shoots to the fall�take this, and pray that he,
Who wrote it, honoring your sweet faith in him,
May trust himself; and spite of praise and scorn,
As one who feels the immeasurable world,
Attain the wise indifference of the wise;
And after Autumn past�if left to pass
His autumn into seeming-leafless days�
Draw toward the long frost and longest night,
Wearing his wisdom lightly, like the fruit
Which in our winter woodland looks a flower.*
