 Old Boreas and the sun, one day
 Espied a traveller on his way,
 Whose dress did happily provide
 Against whatever might betide.
 The time was autumn, when, indeed,
 All prudent travellers take heed.
 The rains that then the sunshine dash,
 And Iris with her splendid sash,
 Warn one who does not like to soak
 To wear abroad a good thick cloak.
 Our man was therefore well bedight
 With double mantle, strong and tight.
 'This fellow,' said the wind, 'has meant
 To guard from every ill event;
 But little does he wot that I
 Can blow him such a blast
 That, not a button fast,
 His cloak shall cleave the sky.
 Come, here's a pleasant game, Sir Sun!
 Wilt play?' Said Phoebus, 'Done!
 We'll bet between us here
 Which first will take the gear
 From off this cavalier.
 Begin, and shut away.
 The brightness of my ray.'
 'Enough.' Our blower, on the bet,
 Swell'd out his pursy form
 With all the stuff for storm - 
 The thunder, hail, and drenching wet,
 And all the fury he could muster;
 Then, with a very demon's bluster,
 He whistled, whirl'd, and splash'd,
 And down the torrents dash'd,
 Full many a roof uptearing
 He never did before,
 Full many a vessel bearing
 To wreck upon the shore, - 
 And all to doff a single cloak.
 But vain the furious stroke;
 The traveller was stout,
 And kept the tempest out,
 Defied the hurricane,
 Defied the pelting rain;
 And as the fiercer roar'd the blast,
 His cloak the tighter held he fast.
 The sun broke out, to win the bet;
 He caused the clouds to disappear,
 Refresh'd and warm'd the cavalier,
 And through his mantle made him sweat,
 Till off it came, of course,
 In less than half an hour;
 And yet the sun saved half his power. - 
 So much doth mildness more than force.
