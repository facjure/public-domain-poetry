I

Never a careworn wife but shows,
 If a joy suffuse her,
Something beautiful to those
 Patient to peruse her,
Some one charm the world unknows
 Precious to a muser,
Haply what, ere years were foes,
 Moved her mate to choose her.

II

But, be it a hint of rose
 That an instant hues her,
Or some early light or pose
 Wherewith thought renews her -
Seen by him at full, ere woes
 Practised to abuse her -
Sparely comes it, swiftly goes,
 Time again subdues her.
