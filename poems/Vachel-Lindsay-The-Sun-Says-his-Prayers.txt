title: The Sun Says his Prayers
---

 "The sun says his prayers," said the fairy,
 Or else he would wither and die.
 "The sun says his prayers," said the fairy,
 "For strength to climb up through the sky.
 He leans on invisible angels,
 And Faith is his prop and his rod.
 The sky is his crystal cathedral.
 And dawn is his altar to God."
