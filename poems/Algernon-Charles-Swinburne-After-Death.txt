The four boards of the coffin lid
Heard all the dead man did.

The first curse was in his mouth,
Made of grave�s mould and deadly drouth.

The next curse was in his head,
Made of God�s work discomfited.

The next curse was in his hands,
Made out of two grave-bands.

The next curse was in his feet,
Made out of a grave-sheet.

�I had fair coins red and white,
And my name was as great light;

I had fair clothes green and red,
And strong gold bound round my head.

But no meat comes in my mouth,
Now I fare as the worm doth;

And no gold binds in my hair,
Now I fare as the blind fare.

My live thews were of great strength,
Now am I waxen a span�s length;

My live sides were full of lust,
Now are they dried with dust.�

The first board spake and said:
�Is it best eating flesh or bread?�

The second answered it:
�Is wine or honey the more sweet?�

The third board spake and said:
�Is red gold worth a girl�s gold head?�

The fourth made answer thus:
�All these things are as one with us.�

The dead man asked of them:
�Is the green land stained brown with flame?

Have they hewn my son for beasts to eat,
And my wife�s body for beasts� meat?

Have they boiled my maid in a brass pan,
And built a gallows to hang my man?�

The boards said to him:
�This is a lewd thing that ye deem.

Your wife has gotten a golden bed,
All the sheets are sewn with red.

Your son has gotten a coat of silk,
The sleeves are soft as curded milk.

Your maid has gotten a kirtle new,
All the skirt has braids of blue.

Your man has gotten both ring and glove,
Wrought well for eyes to love.�

The dead man answered thus:
�What good gift shall God give us?�

The boards answered him anon:
�Flesh to feed hell�s worm upon.�
