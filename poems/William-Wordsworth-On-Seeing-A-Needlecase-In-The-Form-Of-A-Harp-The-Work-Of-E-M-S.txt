title: On Seeing A Needlecase In The Form Of A Harp - The Work Of E.M.S.
---

 Frowns are on every Muse's face,
 Reproaches from their lips are sent,
 That mimicry should thus disgrace
 The noble Instrument.

 A very Harp in all but size!
 Needles for strings in apt gradation!
 Minerva's self would stigmatize
 The unclassic profanation.

 Even her 'own' needle that subdued
 Arachne's rival spirit,
 Though wrought in Vulcan's happiest mood,
 Such honour could not merit.

 And this, too, from the Laureate's Child,
 A living lord of melody!
 How will her Sire be reconciled
 To the refined indignity?

 I spake, when whispered a low voice,
 "Bard! moderate your ire;
 Spirits of all degrees rejoice
 In presence of the lyre.

 The Minstrels of Pygmean bands,
 Dwarf Genii, moonlight-loving Fays,
 Have shells to fit their tiny hands
 And suit their slender lays.

 Some, still more delicate of ear,
 Have lutes (believe my words)
 Whose framework is of gossamer,
 While sunbeams are the chords.

 Gay Sylphs this miniature will court,
 Made vocal by their brushing wings,
 And sullen Gnomes will learn to sport
 Around its polished strings;

 Whence strains to love-sick maiden dear,
 While in her lonely bower she tries
 To cheat the thought she cannot cheer,
 By fanciful embroideries.

 Trust, angry Bard! a knowing Sprite,
 Nor think the Harp her lot deplores!
 Though 'mid the stars the Lyre shine bright,
 Love 'stoops' as fondly as he soars."
