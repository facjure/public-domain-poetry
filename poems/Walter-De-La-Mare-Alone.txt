 The abode of the nightingale is bare,
 Flowered frost congeals in the gelid air,
 The fox howls from his frozen lair:
Alas, my loved one is gone,
I am alone:
It is winter.

 Once the pink cast a winy smell,
 The wild bee hung in the hyacinth bell,
 Light in effulgence of beauty fell:
Alas, my loved one is gone,
I am alone:
It is winter.

 My candle a silent fire doth shed,
 Starry Orion hunts o'erhead;
 Come moth, come shadow, the world is dead:
Alas, my loved one is gone,
I am alone:
It is winter.
