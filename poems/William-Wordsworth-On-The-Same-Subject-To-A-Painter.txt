 Though I beheld at first with blank surprise
 This Work, I now have gazed on it so long
 I see its truth with unreluctant eyes;
 O, my Beloved! I have done thee wrong,
 Conscious of blessedness, but, whence it sprung,
 Ever too heedless, as I now perceive:
 Morn into noon did pass, noon into eve,
 And the old day was welcome as the young,
 As welcome and as beautiful, in sooth
 More beautiful, as being a thing more holy:
 Thanks to thy virtues, to the eternal youth
 Of all thy goodness, never melancholy;
 To thy large heart and humble mind, that cast
 Into one vision, future, present, past.
