title: On The Banks Of A Rocky Stream
---

 Behold an emblem of our human mind
 Crowded with thoughts that need a settled home,
 Yet, like to eddying balls of foam
 Within this whirlpool, they each other chase
 Round and round, and neither find
 An outlet nor a resting-place!
 Stranger, if such disquietude be thine,
 Fall on thy knees and sue for help divine.
