 The sky was like a waterdrop
In shadow of a thorn,
 Clear, tranquil, beautiful,
Dark, forlorn.

 Lightning along its margin ran;
A rumour of the sea
 Rose in profundity and sank
Into infinity.

 Lofty and few the elms, the stars
In the vast boughs most bright;
 I stood a dreamer in a dream
In the unstirring night.

 Not wonder, worship, not even peace
Seemed in my heart to be:
 Only the memory of one,
Of all most dead to me.
