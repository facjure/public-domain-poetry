 Why sleeps the future, as a snake enrolled,
 Coil within coil, at noon-tide? For the WORD
 Yields, if with unpresumptuous faith explored,
 Power at whose touch the sluggard shall unfold
 His drowsy rings. Look forth! that Stream behold,
 That stream upon whose bosom we have passed
 Floating at ease while nations have effaced
 Nations, and Death has gathered to his fold
 Long lines of mighty Kings look forth, my Soul!
 (Nor in this vision be thou slow to trust)
 The living Waters, less and less by guilt
 Stained and polluted, brighten as they roll,
 Till they have reached the eternal City built
 For the perfected Spirit of the just!
