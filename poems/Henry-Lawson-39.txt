I only woke this morning
To find the world is fair,
I�m going on for forty,
With scarcely one grey hair;

I�m going on for forty,
Where man�s strong life begins,
With scarce a sign of crows� feet,
In spite of all my sins.

Then here�s the living Forties!
The Forties! The Forties!
Then here�s the living Forties!
We�re good for ten years more.

The teens were black and bitter,
A smothered boyhood�s grave,
A farm-drudge in the drought-time,
A weary workshop slave.

But twenty years have laid them,
And all the world is fair,
We�ll find time in the Forties,
To have some boyhood there.

Then here�s the wide, free Forties,
The Forties! The Forties!
Then here�s the wide, free Forties!
We�re good for ten years more!

The twenties they were noble,
The bravest years, I think;
�Twas man to man in trouble,
In working and in drink;

�Twas man to man in fighting,
For money or for praise.
And we�ll find in the Forties
Some more Bohemian days.

Then here�s the wiser Forties!
The Forties! The Forties!
Then here�s the wiser Forties!
We�re good for ten years more.

The thirties were the fate years;
I fought behind the scenes.
The thirties were more cruel
And blacker than the teens;

I held them not but bore them,
They were no years of mine;
But they are going from me,
For I am thirty-nine.

So here�s the stronger Forties!
The Forties! The Forties!
And here�s the good old Forties!
We�re good for ten years more.
