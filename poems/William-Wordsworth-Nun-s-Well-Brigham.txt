 The cattle crowding round this beverage clear
 To slake their thirst, with reckless hoofs have trod
 The encircling turf into a barren clod;
 Through which the waters creep, then disappear,
 Born to be lost in Derwent flowing near;
 Yet, o'er the brink, and round the limestone cell
 Of the pure spring (they call it the "Nun's Well,"
 Name that first struck by chance my startled ear)
 A tender Spirit broods, the pensive Shade
 Of ritual honours to this Fountain paid
 By hooded Votaresses with saintly cheer;
 Albeit oft the Virgin-mother mild
 Looked down with pity upon eyes beguiled
 Into the shedding of "too soft a tear."
