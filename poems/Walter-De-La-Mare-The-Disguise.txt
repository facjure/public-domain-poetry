 Why in my heart, O Grief,
 Dost thou in beauty hide?
 Dead is my well-content,
 And buried deep my pride.
 Cold are their stones, beloved,
 To hand and side.

 The shadows of even are gone,
 Shut are the day's clear flowers,
 Now have her birds left mute
 Their singing bowers,
 Lone shall we be, we twain,
 In the night hours.

 Thou with thy cheek on mine,
 And dark hair loosed, shall see
 Take the far stars for fruit
 The cypress tree,
 And in the yew's black
 Shall the moon be.

 We will tell no old tales,
 Nor heed if in wandering air
 Die a lost song of love
 Or the once fair;
 Still as well-water be
 The thoughts we share!

 And, while the ghosts keep
 Tryst from chill sepulchres,
 Dreamless our gaze shall sleep,
 And sealed our ears;
 Heart unto heart will speak,
 Without tears.

 O, thy veiled, lovely face - 
 Joy's strange disguise - 
 Shall be the last to fade
 From these rapt eyes,
 Ere the first dart of daybreak
 Pierce the skies.
