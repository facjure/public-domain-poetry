 Why stand we gazing on the sparkling Brine,
 With wonder smit by its transparency,
 And all-enraptured with its purity?
 Because the unstained, the clear, the crystalline,
 Have ever in them something of benign;
 Whether in gem, in water, or in sky,
 A sleeping infant's brow, or wakeful eye
 Of a young maiden, only not divine.
 Scarcely the hand forbears to dip its palm
 For beverage drawn as from a mountain-well;
 Temptation centres in the liquid Calm;
 Our daily raiment seems no obstacle
 To instantaneous plunging in, deep Sea!
 And reveling in long embrace with thee.
