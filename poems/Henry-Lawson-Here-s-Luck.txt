title: Here's Luck
---

Old Time is tramping close to-day, you hear his bluchers fall,
A mighty change is on the way, an� God protect us all;
Some dust�ll fly from beery coats, at least it�s been declared.
I�m glad that wimin has the votes, but just a trifle scared.

I�m just a trifle scared, For why? The wimin mean to rule;
It makes me feel like days gone by when I was caned at school.
The days of men is nearly dead, of double moons and stars, 
They�ll soon put out our pipes, �tis said, an� close the public bars.

No more we�ll take a glass of ale when pushed with care an� strife,
An�chuckle home with that old tale we used to tell the wife.
We�ll laugh an�joke an� sing no more with jolly beery chums,
An� shout �Here�s luck!� while waitin� for the luck that never comes.

Did we prohibit swillin� tea clean out of common-sense
Or legislate on gossipin� across a backyard fence?
Did we prohibit bustles, or the hoops when they was here?
The wimin never think of this, they want to stop our beer.

The track o� life is dry enough, an� crossed with many a rut,
But, oh! we�ll find it long an� rough when all the pubs is shut,
When all the pubs is shut, an� gone the doors we used to seek,
An� we go toilin�, thirstin� on through Sundays all the week.

For since the days when pubs was �inns�, in years gone past�n� far, 
Poor sinful souls have drowned their sins an� sorrers at the bar;
An� though at times it led to crimes, an� debt, and such complaints, 
I scarce dare think about the time when all mankind is saints.

�Twould make the bones of Bacchus leap an� break his coffin lid;
And Burns�s ghost would wail an� weep as Bobby never did.
But let the preachers preach in style, an� rave and rant, �n� buck,
I rather guess they�ll hear awhile the old war-cry: �Here�s Luck!�

The world might wobble round the sun, an� all the banks go bung,
But pipes�ll smoke an� liquor run while Auld Lang Syne is sung.
While men are driven through the mill, an� flinty times is struck,
They�ll find a private entrance still! Here�s Luck, old man, Here�s Luck!
