Revered, beloved�O you that hold
A nobler office upon earth
Than arms, or power of brain, or birth
Could give the warrior kings of old,

Victoria,�since your Royal grace
To one of less desert allows
This laurel greener from the brows
Of him that utter�d nothing base;

And should your greatness, and the care
That yokes with empire, yield you time
To make demand of modern rhyme
If aught of ancient worth be there;

Then�while a sweeter music wakes,
And thro� wild March the throstle calls,
Where all about your palace-walls
The sun-lit almond-blossom shakes�

Take, Madam, this poor book of song;
For tho� the faults were thick as dust
In vacant chambers, I could trust
Your kindness. May you rule us long,

And leave us rulers of your blood
As noble till the latest day!
May children of our children say,
�She wrought her people lasting good;

�Her court was pure; her life serene;
God gave her peace; her land reposed;
A thousand claims to reverence closed
In her as Mother, Wife, and Queen:

�And statesmen at her council met
Who knew the seasons when to take
Occasion by the hand, and make
The bounds of freedom wider yet

�By shaping some august decree
Which kept her throne unshaken still,
Broad-based upon her people�s will,
And compass�d by the inviolate sea.�
