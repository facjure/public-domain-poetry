title: Hart's-Horn Tree, Near Penrith
---

 Here stood an Oak, that long had borne affixed
 To his huge trunk, or, with more subtle art,
 Among its withering topmost branches mixed,
 The palmy antlers of a hunted Hart,
 Whom the Dog Hercules pursued his part
 Each desperately sustaining, till at last
 Both sank and died, the life-veins of the chased
 And chaser bursting here with one dire smart.
 Mutual the victory, mutual the defeat!
 High was the trophy hung with pitiless pride;
 Say, rather, with that generous sympathy
 That wants not, even in rudest breasts, a seat;
 And, for this feeling's sake, let no one chide
 Verse that would guard thy memory, Hart's-Horn Tree!
