 Boys and girls that held her dear,
 Do your weeping now;
 All you loved of her lies here.

 Brought to earth the arrogant brow,
 And the withering tongue
 Chastened; do your weeping now.

 Sing whatever songs are sung,
 Wind whatever wreath,
 For a playmate perished young,

 For a spirit spent in death.
 Boys and girls that held her dear,
 All you loved of her lies here.
