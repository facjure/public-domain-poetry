 Woe to the Crown that doth the Cowl obey!
 Dissension, checking arms that would restrain
 The incessant Rovers of the northern main,
 Helps to restore and spread a Pagan sway:
 But Gospel-truth is potent to allay
 Fierceness and rage; and soon the cruel Dane
 Feels, through the influence of her gentle reign,
 His native superstitions melt away.
 Thus, often, when thick gloom the east o'ershrouds,
 The full-orbed Moon, slow-climbing, doth appear
 Silently to consume the heavy clouds;
 'How' no one can resolve; but every eye
 Around her sees, while air is hushed, a clear
 And widening circuit of ethereal sky.
