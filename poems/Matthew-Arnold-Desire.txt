 Thou, who dost dwell alone;
 Thou, who dost know thine own;
 Thou, to whom all are known,
 From the cradle to the grave,
 Save, O, save!

 From the world's temptations;
 From tribulations;
 From that fierce anguish
 Wherein we languish;
 From that torpor deep
 Wherein we lie asleep,
 Heavy as death, cold as the grave,
 Save, O, save!

 When the soul, growing clearer,
 Sees God no nearer;
 When the soul, mounting higher,
 To God comes no nigher;
 But the arch-fiend Pride
 Mounts at her side,
 Foiling her high emprize,
 Sealing her eagle eyes,
 And, when she fain would soar,
 Make idols to adore;
 Changing the pure emotion
 Of her high devotion,
 To a skin-deep sense
 Of her own eloquence;
 Strong to deceive, strong to enslave,
 Save, O, save!

 From the ingrained fashion
 Of this earthly nature
 That mars thy creature;
 From grief, that is but passion;
 From mirth, that is but feigning;
 From tears, that bring no healing;
 From wild and weak complaining;
 Thine old strength revealing,
 Save, O, save!

 From doubt, where all is doable,
 Where wise men are not strong;
 Where comfort turns to trouble;
 Where just men suffer wrong;
 Where sorrow treads on joy;
 Where sweet things soonest cloy;
 Where faiths are built on dust;
 Where love is half mistrust,
 Hungry, and barren, and sharp as the sea;
 O, set us free!

 O, let the false dream fly
 Where our sick souls do lie,
 Tossing continually.
 O, where thy voice doth come,
 Let all doubts be dumb;
 Let all words be mild;
 All strife be reconciled;
 All pains beguiled.
 Light brings no blindness;
 Love no unkindness;
 Knowledge no ruin;
 Fear no undoing,
 From the cradle to the grave,
 Save, O, save!
