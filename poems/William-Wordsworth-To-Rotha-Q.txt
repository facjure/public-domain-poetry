title: To Rotha Q......
---

 Rotha, my Spiritual Child! this head was grey
 When at the sacred font for thee I stood;
 Pledged till thou reach the verge of womanhood,
 And shalt become thy own sufficient stay:
 Too late, I feel, sweet Orphan! was the day
 For stedfast hope the contract to fulfil;
 Yet shall my blessing hover o'er thee still,
 Embodied in the music of this Lay,
 Breathed forth beside the peaceful mountain Stream
 Whose murmur soothed thy languid Mother's ear
 After her throes, this Stream of name more dear
 Since thou dost bear it, a memorial theme
 For others; for thy future self, a spell
 To summon fancies out of Time's dark cell.
