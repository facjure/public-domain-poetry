 Bother Bulleys, let us sing
 From the dawn till evening! -
For we know not that we go not
 When the day's pale pinions fold
 Unto those who sang of old.

 When I flew to Blackmoor Vale,
 Whence the green-gowned faeries hail,
Roosting near them I could hear them
 Speak of queenly Nature's ways,
 Means, and moods, - well known to fays.

 All we creatures, nigh and far
 (Said they there), the Mother's are:
Yet she never shows endeavour
 To protect from warrings wild
 Bird or beast she calls her child.

 Busy in her handsome house
 Known as Space, she falls a-drowse;
Yet, in seeming, works on dreaming,
 While beneath her groping hands
 Fiends make havoc in her bands.

 How her hussif'ry succeeds
 She unknows or she unheeds,
All things making for Death's taking!
 - So the green-gowned faeries say
 Living over Blackmoor way.

 Come then, brethren, let us sing,
 From the dawn till evening! -
For we know not that we go not
 When the day's pale pinions fold
 Unto those who sang of old.
