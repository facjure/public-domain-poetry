title: Go Back To Antique Ages, If Thine Eyes
---

 Go back to antique ages, if thine eyes
 The genuine mien and character would trace
 Of the rash Spirit that still holds her place,
 Prompting the world's audacious vanities!
 Go back, and see the Tower of Babel rise;
 The pyramid extend its monstrous base,
 For some Aspirant of our short-lived race,
 Anxious an aery name to immortalize.
 There, too, ere wiles and politic dispute
 Gave specious colouring to aim and act,
 See the first mighty Hunter leave the brute
 To chase mankind, with men in armies packed
 For his field-pastime high and absolute,
 While, to dislodge his game, cities are sacked!
