 How art thou named? In search of what strange land
 From what huge height, descending? Can such force
 Of waters issue from a British source,
 Or hath not Pindus fed thee, where the band
 Of Patriots scoop their freedom out, with hand
 Desperate as thine? Or come the incessant shocks
 From that young Stream, that smites the throbbing rocks
 Of Viamala? There I seem to stand,
 As in life's morn; permitted to behold,
 From the dread chasm, woods climbing above woods,
 In pomp that fades not; everlasting snows;
 And skies that ne'er relinquish their repose;
 Such power possess the family of floods
 Over the minds of Poets, young or old!
