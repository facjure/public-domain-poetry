 "Thou solitary!" the Blackbird cried,
 "I, from the happy Wren,
 Linnet and Blackcap, Woodlark, Thrush,
 Perched all upon a sweetbrier bush,
 Have come at cold of midnight-tide
 To ask thee, Why and when
 Grief smote thy heart so thou dost sing
 In solemn hush of evening,
 So sorrowfully, lovelorn Thing - 
 Nay, nay, not sing, but rave, but wail,
 Most melancholic Nightingale?
 Do not the dews of darkness steep
 All pinings of the day in sleep?
 Why, then, when rocked in starry nest
 We mutely couch, secure, at rest,
 Doth thy lone heart delight to make
 Music for sorrow's sake?"
 A Moon was there. So still her beam,
 It seemed the whole world lay in dream,
 Lulled by the watery sea.
 And from her leafy night-hung nook
 Upon this stranger soft did look
 The Nightingale: sighed he: - 

 "'Tis strange, my friend; the Kingfisher
 But yestermorn conjured me here
 Out of his green and gold to say
 Why thou, in splendour of the noon,
 Wearest of colour but golden shoon,
 And else dost thee array
 In a most sombre suit of black?
 'Surely,' he sighed, 'some load of grief,
 Past all our thinking - and belief - 
 Must weigh upon his back!'
 Do, then, in turn, tell me, If joy
 Thy heart as well as voice employ
 Why dost thou now most Sable, shine
 In plumage woefuller far than mine?
 Thy silence is a sadder thing
 Than any dirge I sing!"

 Thus, then, these two small birds, perched there,
 Breathed a strange riddle both did share
 Yet neither could expound.
 And we - who sing but as we can,
 In the small knowledge of a man - 
 Have we an answer found?
 Nay, some are happy whose delight
 Is hid even from themselves from sight;
 And some win peace who spend
 The skill of words to sweeten despair
 Of finding consolation where
 Life has but one dark end;
 Who, in rapt solitude, tell o'er
 A tale as lovely as forlore,
 Into the midnight air.
