Where art thou gone, light-ankled Youth?
With wing at either shoulder,
And smile that never left thy mouth
Until the Hours grew colder:

Then somewhat seem�d to whisper near
That thou and I must part;
I doubted it; I felt no fear,
No weight upon the heart.

If aught befell it, Love was by
And roll�d it off again;
So, if there ever was a sigh,
�T was not a sigh of pain.

I may not call thee back; but thou
Returnest when the hand
Of gentle Sleep waves o�er my brow
His poppy-crested wand;

Then smiling eyes bend over mine,
Then lips once press�d invite;
But sleep hath given a silent sign,
And both, alas! take flight.
