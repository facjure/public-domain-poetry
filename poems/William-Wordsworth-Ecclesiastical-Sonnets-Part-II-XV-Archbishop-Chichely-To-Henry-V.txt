 "What beast in wilderness or cultured field
 "The lively beauty of the leopard shows?
 "What flower in meadow-ground or garden grows
 "That to the towering lily doth not yield?
 "Let both meet only on thy royal shield!
 "Go forth, great King! claim what thy birth bestows;
 "Conquer the Gallic lily which thy foes
 "Dare to usurp; thou hast a sword to wield,
 "And Heaven will crown the right." The mitred Sire
 Thus spake and lo! a Fleet, for Gaul addrest,
 Ploughs her bold course across the wondering seas;
 For, sooth to say, ambition, in the breast
 Of youthful heroes, is no sullen fire,
 But one that leaps to meet the fanning breeze.
