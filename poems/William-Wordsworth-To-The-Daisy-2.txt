title: To The Daisy (2)

 "Her divine skill taught me this,
 That from every thing I saw
 I could some instruction draw,
 And raise pleasure to the height
 Through the meanest objects sight.
 By the murmur of a spring,
 Or the least bough's rustelling;
 By a Daisy whose leaves spread
 Shut when Titan goes to bed;
 Or a shady bush or tree;
 She could more infuse in me
 Than all Nature's beauties can
 In some other wiser man.'
G. Wither.



 In youth from rock to rock I went,
 From hill to hill in discontent
 Of pleasure high and turbulent,
 Most pleased when most uneasy;
 But now my own delights I make, 
 My thirst at every rill can slake,
 And gladly Nature's love partake,
 Of Thee, sweet Daisy!

 Thee Winter in the garland wears
 That thinly decks his few grey hairs;
 Spring parts the clouds with softest airs,
 That she may sun thee;
 Whole Summer-fields are thine by right;
 And Autumn, melancholy Wight!
 Doth in thy crimson head delight
 When rains are on thee.

 In shoals and bands, a morrice train,
 Thou greet'st the traveller in the lane;
 Pleased at his greeting thee again;
 Yet nothing daunted, 
 Nor grieved if thou be set at nought:
 And oft alone in nooks remote
 We meet thee, like a pleasant thought,
 When such are wanted.

 Be violets in their secret mews
 The flowers the wanton Zephyrs choose;
 Proud be the rose, with rains and dews
 Her head impearling,
 Thou liv'st with less ambitious aim,
 Yet hast not gone without thy fame;
 Thou art indeed by many a claim
 The Poet's darling.

 If to a rock from rains he fly,
 Or, some bright day of April sky,
 Imprisoned by hot sunshine lie
 Near the green holly,
 And wearily at length should fare;
 He needs but look about, and there
 Thou art! a friend at hand, to scare
 His melancholy. 

 A hundred times, by rock or bower,
 Ere thus I have lain couched an hour,
 Have I derived from thy sweet power
 Some apprehension;
 Some steady love; some brief delight;
 Some memory that had taken flight;
 Some chime of fancy wrong or right;
 Or stray invention.

 If stately passions in me burn,
 And one chance look to Thee should turn,
 I drink out of an humbler urn
 A lowlier pleasure;
 The homely sympathy that heeds
 The common life, our nature breeds;
 A wisdom fitted to the needs
 Of hearts at leisure.

 Fresh-smitten by the morning ray,
 When thou art up, alert and gay,
 Then, cheerful Flower! my spirits play
 With kindred gladness: 
 And when, at dusk, by dews opprest
 Thou sink'st, the image of thy rest
 Hath often eased my pensive breast
 Of careful sadness.

 And all day long I number yet,
 All seasons through, another debt,
 Which I, wherever thou art met,
 To thee am owing;
 An instinct call it, a blind sense;
 A happy, genial influence, 
 Coming one knows not how, nor whence,
 Nor whither going.

 Child of the Year! that round dost run
 Thy pleasant course, when day's begun
 As ready to salute the sun
 As lark or leveret,
 Thy long-lost praise thou shalt regain;
 Nor be less dear to future men
 Than in old time; thou not in vain
 Art Nature's favourite.
