title: Song Of A Second April
---

 April this year, not otherwise
 Than April of a year ago,
 Is full of whispers, full of sighs,
 Of dazzling mud and dingy snow;
 Hepaticas that pleased you so
 Are here again, and butterflies.

 There rings a hammering all day,
 And shingles lie about the doors;
 In orchards near and far away
 The grey wood-pecker taps and bores;
 The men are merry at their chores,
 And children earnest at their play.

 The larger streams run still and deep,
 Noisy and swift the small brooks run
 Among the mullein stalks the sheep
 Go up the hillside in the sun,
 Pensively,--only you are gone,
 You that alone I cared to keep.
