 I saw a Mother's eye intensely bent
 Upon a Maiden trembling as she knelt;
 In and for whom the pious Mother felt
 Things that we judge of by a light too faint:
 Tell, if ye may, some star-crowned Muse, or Saint!
 Tell what rushed in, from what she was relieved
 Then, when her Child the hallowing touch received,
 And such vibration through the Mother went
 That tears burst forth amain. Did gleams appear?
 Opened a vision of that blissful place
 Where dwells a Sister-child? And was power given
 Part of her lost One's glory back to trace
 Even to this Rite? For thus 'She' knelt, and, ere
 The summer-leaf had faded, passed to Heaven.
