title: Ecclesiastical Sonnets - Part I. - XXXIII - The Council Of Clermont
---

 "And shall," the Pontiff asks, "profaneness flow
 "From Nazareth, source of Christian piety,
 "From Bethlehem, from the Mounts of Agony
 "And glorified Ascension? Warriors, go,
 "With prayers and blessings we your path will sow;
 "Like Moses hold our hands erect, till ye
 "Have chased far off by righteous victory
 "These sons of Amalek, or laid them low!"
 "God willeth it," the whole assembly cry;
 Shout which the enraptured multitude astounds!
 The Council-roof and Clermont's towers reply;
 "God willeth it," from hill to hill rebounds,
 And, in awe-stricken Countries far and nigh,
 Through "Nature's hollow arch" that voice resounds.
