Pit where the buffalo cooled his hide,
By the hot sun emptied, and blistered and dried;
Log in the plume-grass, hidden and lone;
And where the earth-rat's mounds are strown;
Cave in the bank where the sly stream steals;
Aloe that stabs at the belly and heels,
Jump if you dare on a steed untried
Safer it is to go wide-go wide!
Hark, from in front where the best men ride;
"Pull to the off, boys! Wide! Go wide!"
