 This morning in my attic high
 The Demon came to visit me,
 And seeking faults in my reply,
 He said: "I would inquire of thee,

 "Of all the beauties which compose
 Her charming body's potent spell,
 Of all the objects black and rose
 Which make the thing you love so well,

 "Which is the sweetest?" O my soul!
 Thou didst rejoin: "How tell of parts,
 When all I know is that the whole
 Works magic in my heart of hearts?

 "Where all is fair, how should I say
 What single grace is my delight?
 She shines on me like break of day
 And she consoles me as the night.

 "There flows through all her perfect frame
 A harmony too exquisite
 That weak analysis should name
 The numberless accords of it.

 "O mystic metamorphosis!
 My separate senses all are blent;
 Within her breath soft music is,
 And in her voice a subtle scent!"
