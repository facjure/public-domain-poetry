There never was success so nobly gained,
 Or victory so free from selfish dross,
But in the winning some one had been pained
 Or some one suffered loss.

There never was so nobly planned a fete,
 Or festal throng with hearts on pleasure bent,
But some neglected one outside the gate
 Wept tears of discontent.

There never was a bridal morning fair
 With hope's blue skies and love's unclouded sun
For two fond hearts, that did not bring despair
 To some sad other one.
