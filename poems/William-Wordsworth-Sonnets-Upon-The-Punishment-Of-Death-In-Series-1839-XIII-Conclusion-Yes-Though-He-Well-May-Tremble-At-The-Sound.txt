---

 Yes, though He well may tremble at the sound
 Of his own voice, who from the judgment-seat
 Sends the pale Convict to his last retreat
 In death; though Listeners shudder all around,
 They know the dread requital's source profound;
 Nor is, they feel, its wisdom obsolete
 (Would that it were!) the sacrifice unmeet
 For Christian Faith. But hopeful signs abound;
 The social rights of man breathe purer air,
 Religion deepens her preventive care;
 Then, moved by needless fear of past abuse,
 Strike not from Law's firm hand that awful rod,
 But leave it thence to drop for lack of use:
 Oh, speed the blessed hour, Almighty God!
