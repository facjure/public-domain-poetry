 Come, then, with showers; I love thy cloudy face
Gilded with splendour of the sunbeam thro'
The heedless glory of thy locks. I know
 The arch, sweet languor of thy fleeting grace,
 The windy lovebeams of thy dwelling-place,
Thy dim dells where in azure bluebells blow,
The brimming rivers where thy lightnings go
 Harmless and full and swift from race to race.

 Thou takest all young hearts captive with thine eyes;
At rumour of thee the tongues of children ring
 Louder than bees; the golden poplars rise
Like trumps of peace; and birds, on homeward wing,
 Fly mocking echoes shrill along the skies,
Above the waves' grave diapasoning.
