In Presence Of The Painted Tower Of Tell, At Altorf.


 What though the Italian pencil wrought not here,
 Nor such fine skill as did the meed bestow
 On Marathonian valour, yet the tear
 Springs forth in presence of this gaudy show,
 While narrow cares their limits overflow.
 Thrice happy, burghers, peasants, warriors old,
 Infants in arms, and ye, that as ye go
 Homeward or schoolward, ape what ye behold!
 Heroes before your time, in frolic fancy bold!

 And when that calm Spectatress from on high
 Looks down the bright and solitary Moon,
 Who never gazes but to beautify;
 And snow-fed torrents, which the blaze of noon
 Roused into fury, murmur a soft tune
 That fosters peace, and gentleness recalls;
 'Then' might the passing Monk receive a boon
 Of saintly pleasure from these pictured walls,
 While, on the warlike groups, the mellowing lustre falls.

 How blest the souls who when their trials come
 Yield not to terror or despondency,
 But face like that sweet Boy their mortal doom,
 Whose head the ruddy apple tops, while he
 Expectant stands beneath the linden tree:
 He quakes not like the timid forest game,
 But smiles the hesitating shaft to free;
 Assured that Heaven its justice will proclaim,
 And to his Father give its own unerring aim.
