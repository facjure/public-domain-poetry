title: Only A Sod
---

It's only a sod, but �twill break me ould heart
Nigh hardened wid toilin� and carin�,
And make the ould wounds in it tingle and smart.
It�s only a sod, but it�s parcel and part
Of strugglin�, sufferin� Erin.

It�s only a sod, but it rakes the ould pain,
The ould love in me heart that still lingers,
That Time has been soothing and docth�ring in vain;
And now he must soothe it and heal it again
Wid his kindly and gentle ould fingers.

It�s only a sod, but I see a big ship
Through the gallopin� waters come tearin�,
And a lass that looks back on the horizon dip,
Wid eyes full of tears and a thrimblin� lip,
On the last that she saw of ould Erin.

It�s only a sod, but wid care it will keep
Till me brooms and me brushes are silint
Put it into me arms ere they bury me deep,
And tell them old Biddy the �slavey� does sleep
�Neath a sod from the bogs of ould Irlint.
