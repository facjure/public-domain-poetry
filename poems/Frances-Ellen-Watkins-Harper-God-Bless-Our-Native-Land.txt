title: God Bless Our Native Land.

 God bless our native land,
 Land of the newly free,
 Oh may she ever stand
 For truth and liberty.

 God bless our native land,
 Where sleep our kindred dead,
 Let peace at thy command
 Above their graves be shed.

 God help our native land,
 Bring surcease to her strife,
 And shower from thy hand
 A more abundant life.

 God bless our native land,
 Her homes and children bless,
 Oh may she ever stand
 For truth and righteousness.
