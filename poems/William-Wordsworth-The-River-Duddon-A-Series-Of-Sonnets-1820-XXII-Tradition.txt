 A love-lorn Maid, at some far-distant time,
 Came to this hidden pool, whose depths surpass
 In crystal clearness Dian's looking-glass;
 And, gazing, saw that Rose, which from the prime
 Derives its name, reflected, as the chime
 Of echo doth reverberate some sweet sound:
 The starry treasure from the blue profound
 She longed to ravish; shall she plunge, or climb
 The humid precipice, and seize the guest
 Of April, smiling high in upper air?
 Desperate alternative! what fiend could dare
 To prompt the thought? Upon the steep rock's breast
 The lonely Primrose yet renews its bloom,
 Untouched memento of her hapless doom!
