 Men all, and birds, and creeping beasts,
 When the dark of night is deep,
 From the moving wonder of their lives
 Commit themselves to sleep.

 Without a thought, or fear, they shut
 The narrow gates of sense;
 Heedless and quiet, in slumber turn
 Their strength to impotence.

 The transient strangeness of the earth
 Their spirits no more see:
 Within a silent gloom withdrawn,
 They slumber in secrecy.

 Two worlds they have - a globe forgot
 Wheeling from dark to light;
 And all the enchanted realm of dream
 That burgeons out of night.
