 Ho, Giant!This is I!
 I have built me a bean-stalk into your sky!
 La,--but it's lovely, up so high!

 This is how I came,--I put
 Here my knee, there my foot,
 Up and up, from shoot to shoot--
 And the blessed bean-stalk thinning
 Like the mischief all the time,
 Till it took me rocking, spinning,
 In a dizzy, sunny circle,
 Making angles with the root,
 Far and out above the cackle
 Of the city I was born in,
 Till the little dirty city
 In the light so sheer and sunny
 Shone as dazzling bright and pretty
 As the money that you find
 In a dream of finding money--
 What a wind!What a morning!--

 Till the tiny, shiny city,
 When I shot a glance below,
 Shaken with a giddy laughter,
 Sick and blissfully afraid,
 Was a dew-drop on a blade,
 And a pair of moments after
 Was the whirling guess I made,--
 And the wind was like a whip

 Cracking past my icy ears,
 And my hair stood out behind,
 And my eyes were full of tears,
 Wide-open and cold,
 More tears than they could hold,
 The wind was blowing so,
 And my teeth were in a row,
 Dry and grinning,
 And I felt my foot slip,
 And I scratched the wind and whined,
 And I clutched the stalk and jabbered,
 With my eyes shut blind,--
 What a wind!What a wind!

 Your broad sky, Giant,
 Is the shelf of a cupboard;
 I make bean-stalks, I'm
 A builder, like yourself,
 But bean-stalks is my trade,
 I couldn't make a shelf,
 Don't know how they're made,
 Now, a bean-stalk is more pliant--
 La, what a climb!
