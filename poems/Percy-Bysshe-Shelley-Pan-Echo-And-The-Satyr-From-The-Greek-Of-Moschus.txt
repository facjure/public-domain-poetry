author: Percy Bysshe Shelley 
title: Pan, Echo, And The Satyr. From The Greek Of Moschus.
---

Pan loved his neighbour Echo - but that child
Of Earth and Air pined for the Satyr leaping;
The Satyr loved with wasting madness wild
The bright nymph Lyda, and so three went weeping.
As Pan loved Echo, Echo loved the Satyr,
The Satyr, Lyda; and so love consumed them. -
And thus to each - which was a woeful matter -
To bear what they inflicted Justice doomed them;
For, inasmuch as each might hate the lover,
Each, loving, so was hated. - Ye that love not
Be warned - in thought turn this example over,
That when ye love, the like return ye prove not.
