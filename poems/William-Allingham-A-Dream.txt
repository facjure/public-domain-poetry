I heard the dogs howl in the moonlight night; 
I went to the window to see the sight;
All the Dead that ever I knew 
Going one by one and two by two. 

On they pass'd, and on they pass'd; 
Townsfellows all, from first to last; 
Born in the moonlight of the lane, 
Quench'd in the heavy shadow again. 

Schoolmates, marching as when they play'd 
At soldiers once, but now more staid; 
Those were the strangest sight to me 
Who were drown'd, I knew, in the awful sea.

Straight and handsome folk, bent and weak, too; 
Some that I loved, and gasp'd to speak to;
Some but a day in their churchyard bed; 
Some that I had not known were dead. 

A long, long crowd, where each seem'd lonely, 
Yet of them all there was one, one only, 
Raised a head or look'd my way; 
She linger'd a moment, she might not stay. 

How long since I saw that fair pale face! 
Ah! Mother dear! might I only place 
My head on thy breast, a moment to rest, 
While thy hand on my tearful cheek were prest! 

On, on, a moving bridge they made 
Across the moon-stream, from shade to shade, 
Young and old, women and men; 
Many long-forgot, but remembered then, 

And first there came a bitter laughter;
A sound of tears a moment after; 
And then a music so lofty and gay, 
That eve morning, day by day, 
I strive to recall it if I may.
