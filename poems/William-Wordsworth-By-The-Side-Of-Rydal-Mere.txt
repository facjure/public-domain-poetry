 The linnet's warble, sinking towards a close,
 Hints to the thrush 'tis time for their repose;
 The shrill-voiced thrush is heedless, and again
 The monitor revives his own sweet strain;
 But both will soon be mastered, and the copse
 Be left as silent as the mountain-tops,
 Ere some commanding star dismiss to rest
 The throng of rooks, that now, from twig or nest,
 (After a steady flight on home-bound wings,
 And a last game of mazy hoverings
 Around their ancient grove) with cawing noise
 Disturb the liquid music's equipoise.
 
 O Nightingale! Who ever heard thy song
 Might here be moved, till Fancy grows so strong
 That listening sense is pardonably cheated
 Where wood or stream by thee was never greeted.
 Surely, from fairest spots of favoured lands,
 Were not some gifts withheld by jealous hands,
 This hour of deepening darkness here would be
 As a fresh morning for new harmony;
 And lays as prompt would hail the dawn of Night:
 A 'dawn' she has both beautiful and bright,
 When the East kindles with the full moon's light;
 Not like the rising sun's impatient glow
 Dazzling the mountains, but an overflow
 Of solemn splendour, in mutation slow.
 
 Wanderer by spring with gradual progress led,
 For sway profoundly felt as widely spread;
 To king, to peasant, to rough sailor, dear,
 And to the soldier's trumpet-wearied ear;
 How welcome wouldst thou be to this green Vale
 Fairer than Tempe! Yet, sweet Nightingale!
 From the warm breeze that bears thee on, alight
 At will, and stay thy migratory flight;
 Build, at thy choice, or sing, by pool or fount,
 Who shall complain, or call thee to account?
 The wisest, happiest, of our kind are they
 That ever walk content with Nature's way,
 God's goodness measuring bounty as it may;
 For whom the gravest thought of what they miss,
 Chastening the fullness of a present bliss,
 Is with that wholesome office satisfied,
 While unrepining sadness is allied
 In thankful bosoms to a modest pride.
