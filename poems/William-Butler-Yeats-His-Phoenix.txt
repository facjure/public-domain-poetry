There is a queen in China, or maybe it�s in Spain,
And birthdays and holidays such praises can be heard
Of her unblemished lineaments, a whiteness with no stain,
That she might be that sprightly girl who was trodden by a bird;
And there�s a score of duchesses, surpassing womankind,
Or who have found a painter to make them so for pay
And smooth out stain and blemish with the elegance of his mind:
I knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day.

The young men every night applaud their Gaby�s laughing eye,
And Ruth St. Denis had more charm although she had poor luck;
From nineteen hundred nine or ten, Pavlova�s had the cry,
And there�s a player in the States who gathers up her cloak
And flings herself out of the room when Juliet would be bride
With all a woman�s passion, a child�s imperious way,
And there are�but no matter if there are scores beside:
I knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day.

There�s Margaret and Marjorie and Dorothy and Nan,
A Daphne and a Mary who live in privacy;
One�s had her fill of lovers, another�s had but one,
Another boasts, �I pick and choose and have but two or three.�
If head and limb have beauty and the instep�s high and light,
They can spread out what sail they please for all I have to say,
Be but the breakers of men�s hearts or engines of delight:
I knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day.

There�ll be that crowd to make men wild through all the centuries,
And maybe there�ll be some young belle walk out to make men wild
Who is my beauty�s equal, though that my heart denies,
But not the exact likeness, the simplicity of a child,
And that proud look as though she had gazed into the burning sun,
And all the shapely body no tittle gone astray,
I mourn for that most lonely thing; and yet God�s will be done,
I knew a phoenix in my youth, so let them have their day.
