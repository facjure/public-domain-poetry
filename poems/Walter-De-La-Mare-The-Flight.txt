 How do the days press on, and lay
Their fallen locks at evening down,
 Whileas the stars in darkness play
 And moonbeams weave a crown - 

 A crown of flower-like light in heaven,
Where in the hollow arch of space
 Morn's mistress dreams, and the Pleiads seven
 Stand watch about her place.

 Stand watch - O days no number keep
Of hours when this dark clay is blind.
 When the world's clocks are dumb in sleep
 'Tis then I seek my kind.
