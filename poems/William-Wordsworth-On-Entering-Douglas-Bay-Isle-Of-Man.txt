title: On Entering Douglas Bay, Isle Of Man
---

 The feudal Keep, the bastions of Cohorn,
 Even when they rose to check or to repel
 Tides of aggressive war, oft served as well
 Greedy ambition, armed to treat with scorn
 Just limits; but yon Tower, whose smiles adorn
 This perilous bay, stands clear of all offense;
 Blest work it is of love and innocence,
 A Tower of refuge built for the else forlorn.
 Spare it, ye waves, and lift the mariner,
 Struggling for life, into its saving arms!
 Spare, too, the human helpers! Do they stir
 'Mid your fierce shock like men afraid to die?
 No; their dread service nerves the heart it warms,
 And they are led by noble Hillary.
