 Bruges I saw attired with golden light
 (Streamed from the west) as with a robe of power:
 The splendour fled; and now the sunless hour,
 That, slowly making way for peaceful night,
 Best suits with fallen grandeur, to my sight
 Offers the beauty, the magnificence,
 And sober graces, left her for defense
 Against the injuries of time, the spite
 Of fortune, and the desolating storms
 Of future war. Advance not, spare to hide,
 O gentle Power of darkness! these mild hues;
 Obscure not yet these silent avenues
 Of stateliest architecture, where the Forms
 Of nun-like females, with soft motion, glide!
