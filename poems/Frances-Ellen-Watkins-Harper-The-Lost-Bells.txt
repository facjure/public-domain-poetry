 Year after year the artist wrought
 With earnest, loving care,
 The music flooding all his soul
 To pour upon the air.

 For this no metal was too rare,
 He counted not the cost;
 Nor deemed the years in which he toiled
 As labor vainly lost.

 When morning flushed with crimson light
 The golden gates of day,
 He longed to fill the air with chimes
 Sweet as a matin's lay.

 And when the sun was sinking low
 Within the distant West,
 He gladly heard the bells he wrought
 Herald the hour of rest.

 The music of a thousand harps
 Could never be so dear
 As when those solemn chants and thrills
 Fell on his list'ning ear.

 He poured his soul into their chimes,
 And felt his toil repaid;
 He called them children of his soul,
 His home a'near them made.


 But evil days came on apace,
 War spread his banner wide,
 And from his village snatched away
 The artist's love and pride.

 At dewy morn and stilly eve
 The chimes no more he heard;
 With dull and restless agony
 His spirit's depths was stirred.

 A weary longing filled his soul,
 It bound him like a spell;
 He left his home to seek the chimes -
 The chimes he loved so well.

 Where lofty fanes in grandeur rose,
 Upon his ear there fell
 No music like the long lost chimes
 Of his beloved bell.

 And thus he wandered year by year.
 Touched by the hand of time,
 Seeking to hear with anxious heart
 Each well remembered chime.

 And to that worn and weary heart
 There came a glad surcease:
 He heard again the dear old chimes,
 And smiled and uttered peace.


 "The chimes! the chimes!" the old man cried,
 "I hear their tones at last;"
 A sudden rapture filled his heart,
 And all his cares were past.

 Yes, peace had come with death's sweet calm,
 His journeying was o'er,
 The weary, restless wanderer
 Had reached the restful shore.

 It may be that he met again,
 Enfolded in the air,
 The dear old chimes beside the gates
 Where all is bright and fair;

 That he who crossed and bowed his head
 When Angelus was sung
 In clearer light touched golden harps
 By angel fingers strung.
