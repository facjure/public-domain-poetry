title: Proud Were Ye, Mountains, When, In Times Of Old
---

 Proud were ye, Mountains, when, in times of old,
 Your patriot sons, to stem invasive war,
 Intrenched your brows; ye gloried in each scar:
 Now, for your shame, a Power, the Thirst of Gold,
 That rules o'er Britain like a baneful star,
 Wills that your peace, your beauty, shall be sold,
 And clear way made for her triumphal car
 Through the beloved retreats your arms enfold!
 Heard Ye that Whistle? As her long-linked Train
 Swept onwards, did the vision cross your view?
 Yes, ye were startled; and, in balance true,
 Weighing the mischief with the promised gain,
 Mountains, and Vales, and Floods, I call on you
 To share the passion of a just disdain.
