title: A Song Of The Princess
---

The princess has her lovers,
A score of knights has she,
And each can sing a madrigal,
And praise her gracefully.

But Love that is so bitter
Hath put within her heart
A longing for the scornful knight
Who silent stands apart.

And tho� the others praise and plead,
She maketh no reply,
Yet for a single word from him,
I ween that she would die.
