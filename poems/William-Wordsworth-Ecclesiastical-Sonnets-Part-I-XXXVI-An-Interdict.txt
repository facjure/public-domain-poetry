title: Ecclesiastical Sonnets - Part I. - XXXVI - An Interdict
---

 Realms quake by turns: proud Arbitress of grace,
 The Church, by mandate shadowing forth the power
 She arrogates o'er heaven's eternal door,
 Closes the gates of every sacred place.
 Straight from the sun and tainted air's embrace
 All sacred things are covered: cheerful morn
 Grows sad as night, no seemly garb is worn,
 Nor is a face allowed to meet a face
 With natural smiles of greeting. Bells are dumb;
 Ditches are graves, funereal rites denied;
 And in the churchyard he must take his bride
 Who dares be wedded! Fancies thickly come
 Into the pensive heart ill fortified,
 And comfortless despairs the soul benumb.
