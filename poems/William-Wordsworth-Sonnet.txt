 Why should we weep or mourn, Angelic boy,
 For such thou wert ere from our sight removed,
 Holy, and ever dutiful beloved
 From day to day with never-ceasing joy,
 And hopes as dear as could the heart employ
 In aught to earth pertaining? Death has proved
 His might, nor less his mercy, as behoved,
 Death conscious that he only could destroy
 The bodily frame. That beauty is laid low
 To moulder in a far-off field of Rome;
 But Heaven is now, blest Child, thy Spirit's home:
 When such divine communion, which we know,
 Is felt, thy Roman-burial place will be
 Surely a sweet remembrancer of Thee.
