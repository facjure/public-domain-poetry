 Ambition, following down this far-famed slope
 Her Pioneer, the snow-dissolving Sun,
 While clarions prate of kingdoms to be won
 Perchance, in future ages, here may stop;
 Taught to mistrust her flattering horoscope
 By admonition from this prostrate Stone!
 Memento uninscribed of Pride o'erthrown;
 Vanity's hieroglyphic; a choice trope
 In Fortune's rhetoric. Daughter of the Rock,
 Rest where thy course was stayed by Power divine!
 The Soul transported sees, from hint of thine,
 Crimes which the great Avenger's hand provoke,
 Hears combats whistling o'er the ensanguined heath:
 What groans! what shrieks! what quietness in death.
