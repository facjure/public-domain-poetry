 Not sedentary all: there are who roam
 To scatter seeds of life on barbarous shores;
 Or quit with zealous step their knee-worn floors
 To seek the general mart of Christendom;
 Whence they, like richly-laden merchants, come
 To their beloved cells: or shall we say
 That, like the Red-cross Knight, they urge their way,
 To lead in memorable triumph home
 Truth, their immortal Una? Babylon,
 Learned and wise, hath perished utterly,
 Nor leaves her Speech one word to aid the sigh
 That would lament her; Memphis, Tyre, are gone
 With all their Arts, but classic lore glides on
 By these Religious saved for all posterity.
