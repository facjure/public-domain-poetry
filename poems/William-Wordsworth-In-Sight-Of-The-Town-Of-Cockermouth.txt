title: In Sight Of The Town Of Cockermouth

 A point of life between my Parent's dust,
 And yours, my buried Little-ones! am I;
 And to those graves looking habitually
 In kindred quiet I repose my trust.
 Death to the innocent is more than just,
 And, to the sinner, mercifully bent;
 So may I hope, if truly I repent
 And meekly bear the ills which bear I must:
 And You, my Offspring! that do still remain,
 Yet may outstrip me in the appointed race,
 If e'er, through fault of mine, in mutual pain
 We breathed together for a moment's space,
 The wrong, by love provoked, let love arraign,
 And only love keep in your hearts a place.
