 They heard the South wind sighing
 A murmur of the rain;
 And they knew that Earth was longing
 To see them all again.

 While the snow-drops still were sleeping
 Beneath the silent sod;
 They felt their new life pulsing
 Within the dark, cold clod.

 Not a daffodil nor daisy
 Had dared to raise its head;
 Not a fairhaired dandelion
 Peeped timid from its bed;


 Though a tremor of the winter
 Did shivering through them run;
 Yet they lifted up their foreheads
 To greet the vernal sun.

 And the sunbeams gave them welcome.
 As did the morning air
 And scattered o'er their simple robes
 Rich tints of beauty rare.

 Soon a host of lovely flowers
 From vales and woodland burst;
 But in all that fair procession
 The crocuses were first.

 First to weave for Earth a chaplet
 To crown her dear old head;
 And to beautify the pathway
 Where winter still did tread.

 And their loved and white haired mother
 Smiled sweetly 'neath the touch,
 When she knew her faithful children
 Were loving her so much.
