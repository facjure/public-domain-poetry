 The woman-hearted Confessor prepares
 The evanescence of the Saxon line.
 Hark! 'tis the tolling Curfew! the stars shine;
 But of the lights that cherish household cares
 And festive gladness, burns not one that dares
 To twinkle after that dull stroke of thine,
 Emblem and instrument, from Thames to Tyne,
 Of force that daunts, and cunning that ensnares!
 Yet as the terrors of the lordly bell,
 That quench, from hut to palace, lamps and fires,
 Touch not the tapers of the sacred quires;
 Even so a thraldom, studious to expel
 Old laws, and ancient customs to derange,
 To Creed or Ritual brings no fatal change.
