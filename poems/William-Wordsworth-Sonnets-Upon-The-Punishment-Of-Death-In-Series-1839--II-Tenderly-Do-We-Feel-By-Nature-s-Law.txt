title: Sonnets Upon The Punishment Of Death - In Series, 1839 � II - Tenderly Do We Feel By Nature's Law
---

 Tenderly do we feel by Nature's law
 For worst offenders: though the heart will heave
 With indignation, deeply moved we grieve,
 In after thought, for Him who stood in awe
 Neither of God nor man, and only saw,
 Lost wretch, a horrible device enthroned
 On proud temptations, till the victim groaned
 Under the steel his hand had dared to draw.
 But oh, restrain compassion, if its course,
 As oft befalls, prevent or turn aside
 Judgments and aims and acts whose higher source
 Is sympathy with the unforewarned, who died
 Blameless, with them that shuddered o'er his grave,
 And all who from the law firm safety crave.
