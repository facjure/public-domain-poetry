 In desultory walk through orchard grounds,
 Or some deep chestnut grove, oft have I paused
 The while a Thrush, urged rather than restrained
 By gusts of vernal storm, attuned his song
 To his own genial instincts; and was heard
 (Though not without some plaintive tones between)
 To utter, above showers of blossom swept
 From tossing boughs, the promise of a calm,
 Which the unsheltered traveler might receive
 With thankful spirit. The descant, and the wind
 That seemed to play with it in love or scorn,
 Encouraged and endeared the strain of words
 That haply flowed from me, by fits of silence
 Impelled to livelier pace. But now, my Book!
 Charged with those lays, and others of like mood,
 Or loftier pitch if higher rose the theme,
 Go, single yet aspiring to be joined
 With thy Forerunners that through many a year
 Have faithfully prepared each other's way
 Go forth upon a mission best fulfilled
 When and wherever, in this changeful world,
 Power hath been given to please for higher ends
 Than pleasure only; gladdening to prepare
 For wholesome sadness, troubling to refine,
 Calming to raise; and, by a sapient Art
 Diffused through all the mysteries of our Being,
 Softening the toils and pains that have not ceased
 To cast their shadows on our mother Earth
 Since the primeval doom. Such is the grace
 Which, though unsued for, fails not to descend
 With heavenly inspiration; such the aim
 That Reason dictates; and, as even the wish
 Has virtue in it, why should hope to me
 Be wanting that sometimes, where fancied ills
 Harass the mind and strip from off the bowers
 Of private life their natural pleasantness,
 A Voice devoted to the love whose seeds
 Are sown in every human breast, to beauty
 Lodged within compass of the humblest sight,
 To cheerful intercourse with wood and field,
 And sympathy with man's substantial griefs
 Will not be heard in vain? And in those days
 When unforeseen distress spreads far and wide
 Among a People mournfully cast down,
 Or into anger roused by venal words
 In recklessness flung out to overturn
 The judgment, and divert the general heart
 From mutual good some strain of thine, my Book!
 Caught at propitious intervals, may win
 Listeners who not unwillingly admit
 Kindly emotion tending to console
 And reconcile; and both with young and old
 Exalt the sense of thoughtful gratitude
 For benefits that still survive, by faith
 In progress, under laws divine, maintained.
