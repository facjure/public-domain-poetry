 "How Wallace fought for Scotland, left the name
 Of Wallace to be found, like a wild flower,
 All over his dear Country; left the deeds
 Of Wallace, like a family of ghosts,
 To people the steep rocks and river banks,
 Her natural sanctuaries, with a local soul
 Of independence and stern liberty."
 - See The Prelude, Book I, Lines 214-20.
 
 

 Lord of the vale! astounding Flood;
 The dullest leaf in this thick wood
 Quakes conscious of thy power;
 The caves reply with hollow moan;
 And vibrates, to its central stone,
 Yon time-cemented Tower!

 And yet how fair the rural scene!
 For thou, O Clyde, hast ever been
 Beneficent as strong;
 Pleased in refreshing dews to steep 
 The little trembling flowers that peep
 Thy shelving rocks among.

 Hence all who love their country, love
 To look on thee, delight to rove
 Where they thy voice can hear;
 And, to the patriot-warrior's Shade,
 Lord of the vale! to Heroes laid
 In dust, that voice is dear!

 Along thy banks, at dead of night
 Sweeps visibly the Wallace Wight; 
 Or stands, in warlike vest,
 Aloft, beneath the moon's pale beam,
 A Champion worthy of the stream,
 Yon grey tower's living crest!

 But clouds and envious darkness hide
 A Form not doubtfully descried:
 Their transient mission o'er,
 O say to what blind region flee
 These Shapes of awful phantasy?
 To what untrodden shore? 

 Less than divine command they spurn;
 But this we from the mountains learn,
 And this the valleys show;
 That never will they deign to hold
 Communion where the heart is cold
 To human weal and woe.

 The man of abject soul in vain
 Shall walk the Marathonian plain;
 Or thrid the shadowy gloom,
 That still invests the guardian Pass, 
 Where stood, sublime, Leonidas
 Devoted to the tomb.

 And let no Slave his head incline,
 Or kneel, before the votive shrine
 By Uri's lake, where Tell
 Leapt, from his storm-vext boat, to land,
 Heaven's Instrument, for by his hand
 That day the Tyrant fell.
