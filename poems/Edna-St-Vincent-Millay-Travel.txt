 The railroad track is miles away,
 And the day is loud with voices speaking,
 Yet there isn't a train goes by all day
 But I hear its whistle shrieking.

 All night there isn't a train goes by,
 Though the night is still for sleep and dreaming
 But I see its cinders red on the sky,
 And hear its engine steaming.

 My heart is warm with the friends I make,
 And better friends I'll not be knowing,
 Yet there isn't a train I wouldn't take,
 No matter where it's going.
