 I towered far, and lo! I stood within
 The presence of the Lord Most High,
Sent thither by the sons of earth, to win
 Some answer to their cry.

 - "The Earth, say'st thou? The Human race?
 By Me created? Sad its lot?
Nay: I have no remembrance of such place:
 Such world I fashioned not." -

 - "O Lord, forgive me when I say
 Thou spak'st the word, and mad'st it all." -
"The Earth of men - let me bethink me . . . Yea!
 I dimly do recall

 "Some tiny sphere I built long back
 (Mid millions of such shapes of mine)
So named . . . It perished, surely - not a wrack
 Remaining, or a sign?

 "It lost my interest from the first,
 My aims therefor succeeding ill;
Haply it died of doing as it durst?" -
 "Lord, it existeth still." -

 "Dark, then, its life! For not a cry
 Of aught it bears do I now hear;
Of its own act the threads were snapt whereby
 Its plaints had reached mine ear.

 "It used to ask for gifts of good,
 Till came its severance self-entailed,
When sudden silence on that side ensued,
 And has till now prevailed.

 "All other orbs have kept in touch;
 Their voicings reach me speedily:
Thy people took upon them overmuch
 In sundering them from me!

 "And it is strange - though sad enough -
 Earth's race should think that one whose call
Frames, daily, shining spheres of flawless stuff
 Must heed their tainted ball! . . .

 "But say'st thou 'tis by pangs distraught,
 And strife, and silent suffering? -
Deep grieved am I that injury should be wrought
 Even on so poor a thing!

 "Thou should'st have learnt that Not to Mend
 For Me could mean but Not to Know:
Hence, Messengers! and straightway put an end
 To what men undergo." . . .

 Homing at dawn, I thought to see
 One of the Messengers standing by.
- Oh, childish thought! . . . Yet oft it comes to me
 When trouble hovers nigh.
