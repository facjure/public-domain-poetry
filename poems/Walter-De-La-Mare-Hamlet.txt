 Umbrageous cedars murmuring symphonies
 Stooped in late twilight o'er dark Denmark's Prince:
 He sat, his eyes companioned with dream - 
 Lustrous large eyes that held the world in view
 As some entranc�d child's a puppet show.
 Darkness gave birth to the all-trembling stars,
 And a far roar of long-drawn cataracts,
 Flooding immeasurable night with sound.
 He sat so still, his very thoughts took wing,
 And, lightest Ariels, the stillness haunted
 With midge-like measures; but, at last, even they
 Sank 'neath the influences of his night.
 The sweet dust shed faint perfume in the gloom;
 Through all wild space the stars' bright arrows fell
 On the lone Prince - the troubled son of man - 
 On Time's dark waters in unearthly trouble:
 Then, as the roar increased, and one fair tower
 Of cloud took sky and stars with majesty,
 He rose, his face a parchment of old age,
 Sorrow hath scribbled o'er, and o'er, and o'er.
