 Homeward we turn. Isle of Columba's Cell,
 Where Christian piety's soul-cheering spark
 (Kindled from Heaven between the light and dark
 Of time) shone like the morning-star, farewell!
 And fare thee well, to Fancy visible,
 Remote St. Kilda, lone and loved sea-mark
 For many a voyage made in her swift bark,
 When with more hues than in the rainbow dwell
 Thou a mysterious intercourse dost hold,
 Extracting from clear skies and air serene,
 And out of sun-bright waves, a lucid veil,
 That thickens, spreads, and, mingling fold with fold,
 Makes known, when thou no longer canst be seen,
 Thy whereabout, to warn the approaching sail.
