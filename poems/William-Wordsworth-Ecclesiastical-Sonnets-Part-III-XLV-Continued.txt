 They dreamt not of a perishable home
 Who thus could build. Be mine, in hours of fear
 Or groveling thought, to seek a refuge here;
 Or through the aisles of Westminster to roam:
 Where bubbles burst, and folly's dancing foam
 Melts, if it cross the threshold; where the wreath
 Of awe-struck wisdom droops: or let my path
 Lead to that younger Pile, whose sky-like dome
 Hath typified by reach of daring art
 Infinity's embrace; whose guardian crest,
 The silent Cross, among the stars shall spread
 As now, when She hath also seen her breast
 Filled with mementos, satiate with its part
 Of grateful England's overflowing Dead.
