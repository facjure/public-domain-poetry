(Written for music to be sung at a parish industrial exhibition)

See the land, her Easter keeping,
 Rises as her Maker rose.
Seeds, so long in darkness sleeping,
 Burst at last from winter snows.
Earth with heaven above rejoices;
 Fields and gardens hail the spring;
Shaughs and woodlands ring with voices,
 While the wild birds build and sing.

You, to whom your Maker granted
 Powers to those sweet birds unknown,
Use the craft by God implanted;
 Use the reason not your own.
Here, while heaven and earth rejoices,
 Each his Easter tribute bring - 
Work of fingers, chant of voices,
 Like the birds who build and sing.

Eversley, 1867.
