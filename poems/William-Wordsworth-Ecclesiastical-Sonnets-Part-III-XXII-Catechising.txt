 From Little down to Least, in due degree,
 Around the Pastor, each in new-wrought vest,
 Each with a vernal posy at his breast,
 We stood, a trembling, earnest Company!
 With low soft murmur, like a distant bee,
 Some spake, by thought-perplexing fears betrayed;
 And some a bold unerring answer made:
 How fluttered then thy anxious heart for me,
 Beloved Mother! Thou whose happy hand
 Had bound the flowers I wore, with faithful tie:
 Sweet flowers! at whose inaudible command
 Her countenance, phantom-like, doth reappear:
 O lost too early for the frequent tear,
 And ill requited by this heartfelt sigh!
