---

If this importunate heart trouble your peace
With words lighter than air,
Or hopes that in mere hoping flicker and cease;
Crumple the rose in your hair;
And cover your lips with odorous twilight and say,
�O Hearts of wind-blown flame!
�O Winds, elder than changing of night and day,
�That murmuring and longing came,
�From marble cities loud with tabors of old
�In dove-gray faery lands;
�From battle banners fold upon purple fold,
�Queens wrought with glimmering hands;
�That saw young Niamh hover with love-lorn face
�Above the wandering tide;
�And lingered in the hidden desolate place,
�Where the last Phoenix died
�And wrapped the flames above his holy head;
�And still murmur and long:
�O Piteous Hearts, changing till change be dead
�In a tumultuous song:�
And cover the pale blossoms of your breast
With your dim heavy hair,
And trouble with a sigh for all things longing for rest
The odorous twilight there.
