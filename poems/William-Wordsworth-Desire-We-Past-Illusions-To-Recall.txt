title: Desire We Past Illusions To Recall
---

 Desire we past illusions to recall?
 To reinstate wild Fancy, would we hide
 Truths whose thick veil Science has drawn aside?
 No, let this Age, high as she may, install
 In her esteem the thirst that wrought man's fall,
 The universe is infinitely wide;
 And conquering Reason, if self-glorified,
 Can nowhere move uncrossed by some new wall
 Or gulf of mystery, which thou alone,
 Imaginative Faith! canst overleap,
 In progress toward the fount of Love, the throne
 Of Power whose ministers the records keep
 Of periods fixed, and laws established, less
 Flesh to exalt than prove its nothingness.
