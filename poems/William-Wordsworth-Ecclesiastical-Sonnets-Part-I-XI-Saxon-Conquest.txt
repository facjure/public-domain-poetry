title: Ecclesiastical Sonnets - Part I. - XI - Saxon Conquest

 Nor wants the cause the panic-striking aid
 Of hallelujahs tost from hill to hill
 For instant victory. But Heaven's high will
 Permits a second and a darker shade
 Of Pagan night. Afflicted and dismayed,
 The Relics of the sword flee to the mountains:
 O wretched Land! whose tears have flowed like fountains;
 Whose arts and honours in the dust are laid
 By men yet scarcely conscious of a care
 For other monuments than those of Earth;
 Who, as the fields and woods have given them birth,
 Will build their savage fortunes only there;
 Content, if foss, and barrow, and the girth
 Of long-drawn rampart, witness what they were.
