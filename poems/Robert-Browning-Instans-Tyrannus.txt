I.
Of the million or two, more or less,
I rule and possess,
One man, for some cause undefined,
Was least to my mind.

II.
I struck him, he grovelled of course,
For, what was his force?
I pinned him to earth with my weight
And persistence of hate:
And he lay, would not moan, would not curse,
As his lot might be worse.

III.
�Were the object less mean, would he stand
At the swing of my hand!
For obscurity helps him and blots
The hole where he squats.�
So, I set my five wits on the stretch
To inveigle the wretch.
All in vain! Gold and jewels I threw,
Still he couched there perdue;
I tempted his blood and his flesh,
Hid in roses my mesh,
Choicest cates and the flagon�s best spilth,
Still he kept to his filth.

IV.
Had he kith now or kin, were access
To his heart, did I press:
Just a son or a mother to seize!
No such booty as these.
Were it simply a friend to pursue
�Mid my million or two,
Who could pay me in person or pelf
What he owes me himself!
No: I could not but smile through my chafe,
For the fellow lay safe
As his mates do, the midge and the nit,
Through minuteness, to wit.

V.
Then a humour more great took its place
At the thought of his face,
The droop, the low cares of the mouth,
The trouble uncouth
�Twixt the brows, all that air one is fain
To put out of its pain.
And, �no!� I admonished myself,
�Is one mocked by an elf,
Is one baffled by toad or by rat?
The gravamen�s in that!
How the lion, who crouches to suit
His back to my foot,
Would admire that I stand in debate!
But the small turns the great
If it vexes you, that is the thing!
Toad or rat vex the king?
Though I waste half my realm to unearth
Toad or rat, �tis well worth!�

VI.
So, I soberly laid my last plan
To extinguish the man.
Round his creep-hole, with never a break
Ran my fires for his sake;
Over-head, did my thunder combine
With my underground mine:
Till I looked from my labour content
To enjoy the event.

VII.
When sudden . . . how think ye, the end?
Did I say �without friend�?
Say rather, from marge to blue marge
The whole sky grew his targe
With the sun�s self for visible boss,
While an Arm ran across
Which the earth heaved beneath like a breast
Where the wretch was safe prest!
Do you see? Just my vengeance complete,
The man sprang to his feet,
Stood erect, caught at God�s skirts, and prayed!
So, I was afraid!
