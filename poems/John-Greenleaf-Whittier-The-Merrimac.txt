�The Indians speak of a beautiful river, far to the south,
which they call Merrimac.� - SIEUR. DE MONTS, 1604.


Stream of my fathers! sweetly still
The sunset rays thy valley fill;
Poured slantwise down the long defile,
Wave, wood, and spire beneath them smile.
I see the winding Powow fold
The green hill in its belt of gold,
And following down its wavy line,
Its sparkling waters blend with thine.
There �s not a tree upon thy side,
Nor rock, which thy returning tide
As yet hath left abrupt and stark
Above thy evening water-mark;
No calm cove with its rocky hem,
No isle whose emerald swells begin
Thy broad, smooth current; not a sail
Bowed to the freshening ocean gale;
No small boat with its busy oars,
Nor gray wall sloping to thy shores;
Nor farm-house with its maple shade,
Or rigid poplar colonnade,
But lies distinct and full in sight,
Beneath this gush of sunset light.
Centuries ago, that harbor-bar,
Stretching its length of foam afar,
And Salisbury�s beach of shining sand,
And yonder island�s wave-smoothed strand,
Saw the adventurer�s tiny sail,
Flit, stooping from the eastern gale;
And o�er these woods and waters broke
The cheer from Britain�s hearts of oak,
As brightly on the voyager�s eye,
Weary of forest, sea, and sky,
Breaking the dull continuous wood,
The Merrimac rolled down his flood;
Mingling that clear pellucid brook,
Which channels vast Agioochook
When spring-time�s sun and shower unlock
The frozen fountains of the rock,
And more abundant waters given
From that pure lake, �The Smile of Heaven,�
Tributes from vale and mountain-side,
With ocean�s dark, eternal tide!

On yonder rocky cape, which braves
The stormy challenge of the waves,
Midst tangled vine and dwarfish wood,
The hardy Anglo-Saxon stood,
Planting upon the topmost crag
The staff of England�s battle-flag;
And, while from out its heavy fold
Saint George�s crimson cross unrolled,
Midst roll of drum and trumpet blare,
And weapons brandishing in air,
He gave to that lone promontory
The sweetest name in all his story;
Of her, the flower of Islam�s daughters,
Whose harems look on Stamboul�s waters,
Who, when the chance of war had bound
The Moslem chain his limbs around,
Wreathed o�er with silk that iron chain,
Soothed with her smiles his hours of pain,
And fondly to her youthful slave
A dearer gift than freedom gave.

But look! the yellow light no more
Streams down on wave and verdant shore;
And clearly on the calm air swells
The twilight voice of distant bells.
From Ocean�s bosom, white and thin,
The mists come slowly rolling in;
Hills, woods, the river�s rocky rim,
Amidst the sea like vapor swim,
While yonder lonely coast-light, set
Within its wave-washed minaret,
Half quenched, a beamless star and pale,
Shines dimly through its cloudy veil!

Home of my fathers! I have stood
Where Hudson rolled his lordly flood
Seen sunrise rest and sunset fade
Along his frowning Palisade;
Looked down the Appalachian peak
On Juniata�s silver streak;
Have seen along his valley gleam
The Mohawk�s softly winding stream;
The level light of sunset shine
Through broad Potomac�s hem of pine;
And autumn�s rainbow-tinted banner
Hang lightly o�er the Susquehanna;
Yet wheresoe�er his step might be,
Thy wandering child looked back to thee!
Heard in his dreams thy river�s sound
Of murmuring on its pebbly bound,
The unforgotten swell and roar
Of waves on thy familiar shore;
And saw, amidst the curtained gloom
And quiet of his lonely room,
Thy sunset scenes before him pass;
As, in Agrippa�s magic glass,
The loved and lost arose to view,
Remembered groves in greenness grew,
Bathed still in childhood�s morning dew,
Along whose bowers of beauty swept
Whatever Memory�s mourners wept,
Sweet faces, which the charnel kept,
Young, gentle eyes, which long had slept;
And while the gazer leaned to trace,
More near, some dear familiar face,
He wept to find the vision flown,
A phantom and a dream alone!
