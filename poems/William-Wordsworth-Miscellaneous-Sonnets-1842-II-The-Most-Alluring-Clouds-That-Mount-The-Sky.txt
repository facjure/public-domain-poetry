title: Miscellaneous Sonnets, 1842 - II - The Most Alluring Clouds That Mount The Sky
---

 The most alluring clouds that mount the sky
 Owe to a troubled element their forms,
 Their hues to sunset. If with raptured eye
 We watch their splendour, shall we covet storms,
 And wish the Lord of day his slow decline
 Would hasten, that such pomp may float on high?
 Behold, already they forget to shine,
 Dissolve and leave, to him who gazed, a sigh.
 Not loth to thank each moment for its boon
 Of pure delight, come whencesoe'er it may,
 Peace let us seek, to steadfast things attune
 Calm expectations, leaving to the gay
 And volatile their love of transient bowers,
 The house that cannot pass away be ours.
