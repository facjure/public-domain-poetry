title: The Poet Pleads With His Friend For Old Friends
---

Though you are in your shining days,
Voices among the crowd
And new friends busy with your praise,
Be not unkind or proud,
But think about old friends the most:
Time�s bitter flood will rise,
Your beauty perish and be lost
For all eyes but these eyes.
