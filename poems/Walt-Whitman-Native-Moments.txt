Native moments! when you come upon me - Ah you are here now! 
Give me now libidinous joys only! 
Give me the drench of my passions! 
Give me life coarse and rank! To-day, 
I go consort with nature's darlings - to-night too;
I am for those who believe in loose delights - I share the midnight orgies of young men; 
I dance with the dancers, and drink with the drinkers; 
The echoes ring with our indecent calls; 
I take for my love some prostitute - I pick out some low person for my dearest friend, 
He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate - he shall be one condemn'd by others for deeds done; 
I will play a part no longer - Why should I exile myself from my companions?
O you shunn'd persons! I at least do not shun you, I come forthwith in your midst - I will be your poet, 
I will be more to you than to any of the rest.
