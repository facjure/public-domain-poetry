title: Rest And Be Thankful! - At The Head Of Glencroe
---

 Doubling and doubling with laborious walk,
 Who, that has gained at length the wished-for Height,
 This brief this simple wayside Call can slight,
 And rests not thankful? Whether cheered by talk
 With some loved friend, or by the unseen hawk
 Whistling to clouds and sky-born streams that shine,
 At the sun's outbreak, as with light divine,
 Ere they descend to nourish root and stalk
 Of valley flowers. Nor, while the limbs repose,
 Will we forget that, as the fowl can keep
 Absolute stillness, poised aloft in air,
 And fishes front, unmoved, the torrent's sweep,
 So may the Soul, through powers that Faith bestows,
 Win rest, and ease, and peace, with bliss that Angels share.
