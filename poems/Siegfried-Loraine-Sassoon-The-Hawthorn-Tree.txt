Not much to me is yonder lane
 Where I go every day;
But when there's been a shower of rain
 And hedge-birds whistle gay,
I know my lad that's out in France
 With fearsome things to see
Would give his eyes for just one glance
 At our white hawthorn tree.
 *****
Not much to me is yonder lane
 Where he so longs to tread;
But when there's been a shower of rain
I think I'll never weep again
 Until I've heard he's dead.
