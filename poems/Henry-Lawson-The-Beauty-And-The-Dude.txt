title: The Beauty And The Dude
---

A fresh sweet-scented beauty
Came tripping down the street;
She was as fair a vision
As you might chance to meet.
A masher raised his cady
(I don�t want to be rude)
He raised it to the lady,
That fresh sweet-scented dude.

They met and talked and simpered
And giggled in the street;
They were as bright a vision
As you might wish to meet.
I don�t know what they�re good for,
But don�t want to be rude
To the fair sweet-scented beauty
Or the well-upholstered dude.
