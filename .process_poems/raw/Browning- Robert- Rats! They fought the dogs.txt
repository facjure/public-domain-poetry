Reader, maybe it is with hatred that you want to start this book! Who says you won't sniff, bathed in countless pleasures, as you say, with your nose, proud, large and lean, or turn your belly up like a shark in the beautiful and black air? As if you understand the importance of this act and the equal importance of your legitimate hunger, slowly and majestically, fuming red? You monster, I assure you that the two shapeless nostrils of your ugly snout will feel delighted if you breathe in three thousand times before the Eternal! Your nostrils, which will be disproportionately dilated by contentment, a still ecstasy, do not ask for something better in space, having been embalmed in fragrant perfume and incense, for they will be satisfied with a complete happiness, like angels who live in the magnificence and peacefulness of a pleasant heaven.
