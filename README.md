# Public Domain Poetry

Thousands of poems in the public domain live buried in school libraries, archaic websites, journals gone out of print. We don't have a free, unified access. An open library.

Let's build one.

## Overview

Poems are restored with [Zenup](https://github.com/facjure/zenup), an open format for prose and poetry.

Accompanied Python scripts provide a convenient way to read, evaluate, and print the results of a poem or a directory of poems.

Scripts require Python 2.7.x.

## Status

40,000 poems are available in this git repo. However future poems will be curated in [Elasticsearch](http://elasticsearch.org/) for better scalability.

## Credit

Thanks to the original sites that hosted thousands of public domain poetry:

- [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org)
- [Public Domain Poetry](http://www.public-domain-poetry.com)

Special thanks to Ata Moharreri, former managing editor of [The Massachusetts Review](http://www.massreview.org/editors) for curating the initial [1500 poems](https://github.com/facjure/poetroid-prototype).
