Yet I would not have all yet;
  He that hath all can have no more;
And since my love doth every day admit	        25
New growth, thou shouldst have new rewards in store.
Thou canst not every day give me thy heart;
If thou canst give it, then thou never gav’st it:
Love’s riddles are that, though thy heart depart,
It stays at home, and thou with losing sav’st it,	        30
But we will love a way more liberal
Than changing hearts,—to join them; so we shall
    Be one, an one another’s All.
