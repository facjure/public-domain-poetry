V. MOON-GLOW

I wonder if, dim centuries ago,
We watched the moon together, on some night
When stars hung very near, and softly bright?
I wonder if my tired head drooped low
Against your breast?  And if you seemed to know
(As you know now) the dreams that, like a light,
Shone in my soul?  For, dear, it seems so right—
So very right that you should hold me so!

Here, in the moonlight, there is nothing new,
The very arms that crush me to your heart,
Seem almost like a memory, a part
Of some vague yesterday that has come true—
I feel tonight as if I, dear, might start
A journey back, across the years, with you!
