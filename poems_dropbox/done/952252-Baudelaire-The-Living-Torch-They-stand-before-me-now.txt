They stand before me now, those eyes that shine,
No doubt inspired by an Angel wise;
They stand, those God-like brothers that are mine,
And pour their diamond fires in my eyes.

From all transgressions, from all snares, they save,
Towards the Path of Joy they guide my ways;
They are my servants, and I am their slave;
And all my soul, this living torch obeys.

You charming Eyes—you have those mystic beams,
Of candles, burning in full day; the sun
Awakes, but kills not their fantastic gleams:

You sing the Awakening, they the dark oblivion;
The Awakening of my spirit you proclaim,
Stars— no sun can ever kill your flame!
