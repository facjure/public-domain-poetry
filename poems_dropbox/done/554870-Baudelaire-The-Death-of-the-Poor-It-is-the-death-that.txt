It is Death that consoles— yes, and causes our lives;
It is the goal of this Life— and of Hope the sole ray,
Which like a strong potion enlivens and gives
Us the strength to plod on to the end of the day.

And all through the tempest, the frost and the snows,
It is the shimmering light on our black sky-line;
It is the famous inn which the guide-book shows,
Whereat one can eat, and sleep, and recline;

It is an angel that holds in his magic hands
The sleep, which ecstatic dream commands,
Who remakes up the beds of the naked and poor;

It is the fame of the gods, it is the granary blest,
It is the purse of the poor, and his birth-place of rest,
To the unknown Heavens, it is the wide-open door.
