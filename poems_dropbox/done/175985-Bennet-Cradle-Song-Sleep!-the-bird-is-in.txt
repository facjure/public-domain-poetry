Sleep! the bird is in its nest;
Sleep! the bee is hushed in rest;
Sleep! rocked on your mother’s breast!
Lullaby!
To your mother’s fond heart pressed,
Lullaby!
Sleep! the waning daylight dies;
Sleep! the stars dream in the skies;
Daisies long have closed their eyes;
Lullaby!
Calm, how calm on all things lies!
Lullaby!
Sleep then, sleep! my heart’s delight!
Sleep! and through the darksome night
Round your bed God’s angels bright
Lullaby!
Guard you till I come with light!
Lullaby!
