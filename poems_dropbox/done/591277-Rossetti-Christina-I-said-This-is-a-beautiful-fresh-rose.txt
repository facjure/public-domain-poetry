Once and For All

I said: This is a beautiful fresh rose.
  I said: I will delight me with its scent,
  Will watch its lovely curve of languishment,
Will watch its leaves unclose, its heart unclose.
I said: Old Earth has put away her snows,
  All living things make merry to their bent,
  A flower is come for every flower that went
In autumn; the sun glows, the south wind blows.
So walking in a garden of delight
  I came upon one sheltered shadowed nook
Where broad leaf shadows veiled the day with night,
  And there lay snow unmelted by the sun:--
I answered: Take who will the path I took,
  Winter nips once for all; love is but one.
