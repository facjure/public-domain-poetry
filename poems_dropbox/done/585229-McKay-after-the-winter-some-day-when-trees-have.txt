Some day, when trees have shed their leaves,	
  And against the morning’s white	
The shivering birds beneath the eaves	
  Have sheltered for the night,	
We’ll turn our faces southward, love,	        5
  Toward the summer isle	
Where bamboos spire the shafted grove	
  And wide-mouthed orchids smile.	
 
And we will seek the quiet hill	
  Where towers the cotton tree,	        10
And leaps the laughing crystal rill,	
  And works the droning bee.	
And we will build a lonely nest	
  Beside an open glade,	
And there forever will we rest,	        15
  O love—O nut-brown maid!
