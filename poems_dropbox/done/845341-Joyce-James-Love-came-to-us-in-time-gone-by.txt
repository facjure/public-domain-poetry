     Love came to us in time gone by
     When one at twilight shyly played
     And one in fear was standing nigh—
     For Love at first is all afraid.

     We were grave lovers. Love is past
     That had his sweet hours many a one;
     Welcome to us now at the last
     The ways that we shall go upon.
