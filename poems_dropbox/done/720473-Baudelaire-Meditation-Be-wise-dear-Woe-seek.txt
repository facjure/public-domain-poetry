Be wise, dear Woe, seek your grievance to drown,
You did call for the night, and behold it is here,
An atmosphere sombre, envelopes the town,
To some bringing peace and to others a care.

While the manifold souls of the vile multitude,
Beeath the lash of enjoyment, that merciless sway,
Go plucking remorse from the menial brood,
From them far, dear Grief, hold my hand, come this way.

Behold how they beckon, those years, long expired,
From Heaven, in faded apparel attired,
How Regret, smiling, foams on the waters like yeast;

Its arches of slumber the dying sun spreads,
And like a long winding-sheet dragged to the East,
Listen Beloved, how the Night softly treads!
