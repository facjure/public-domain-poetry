Free man! the sea is to you ever dear!
The sea is your mirror, you regard your soul
In its mighty waves that unendingly roll,
And your spirit is yet not a chasm less dreary.

You delight to plunge deep in your image down;
You Take it with eyes and with arms in embrace,
And at times your own inward voice wouldn't efface
With the sound of its savage ungovernable moan.

Both of you are sombre, secretive and deep:
mortal, your depths are unexplored,
sea— no one knows your dazzling hoard,
You both are so jealous, your secrets to keep!

And endless ages have wandered by,
And still without pity or mercy you fight,
So mighty in plunder and death your delight:
Wrestlers! so constant in animosity!
