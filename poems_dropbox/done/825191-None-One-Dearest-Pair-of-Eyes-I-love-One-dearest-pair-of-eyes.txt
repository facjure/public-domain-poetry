One dearest pair of eyes I love!
  Entranced my heart beneath their spell—
Clearer than clearest ray they are,
  But where they are—I will not tell!
Through silk of wondrous lashes soft,
  Their burning beams are flashing bright,
Upon my knees, a slave I kneel—
  Before those miracles of light.
The storm is growing in my soul,
  Tempest of pain and happiness—
I love one dearest pair of eyes,
  But whose they are—I'll not confess!
