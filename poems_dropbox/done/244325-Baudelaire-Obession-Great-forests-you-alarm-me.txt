Great forests, you alarm me like a mighty shrine;
Like organ-tones you roar, and in our hearts of stone,
Where ancient sobs vibrate, halls of endless pain!
The answering echoes of your "De Profundis" moan.

I hate you, Ocean! hate your tumults and your throbs,
My spirit finds them in himself. This bitter glee
Of vanquished mortals, full of insults and of sobs,
I hear it in the mighty laughter of the sea.

Starless night! your loveliness my soul inhales,
Without those starry rays which speak a language known,
For I desire the dark, the naked and the lone.

But even those darknesses themselves to me are veils,
Where live—and, by the millions beneath my eyelids prance,
Long, long departed Beings with familiar glance.
