When, with eyes closed, on a hot afternoon,
The scent of your passionate breast I inhale,
Celestial vistas my spirit assail;
Caressed by the flames of an endless sun.

A languorous island, where Nature abounds
With exotic trees and luscious fruit;
And with men whose bodies are slim and astute,
And with women whose frankness delights and astounds.

By your perfume enticed to this region remote,
A port I see, laden with mast and with boat,
Still wearied and torn by the distant brine;

While the tamarisk-odors that dreamily throng
The air, round my slumberous senses intwine,
And mix, in my soul, with the mariners' song.
