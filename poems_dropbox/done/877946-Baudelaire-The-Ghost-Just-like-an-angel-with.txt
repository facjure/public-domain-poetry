Just like an angel with evil eye,
I will return to you silently,
Upon your gazebo I'll alight,
With falling shadows of the night.

With you, my brownie, I'll commune,
And give you kisses as cold as the moon,
And with a serpent's moist embrace,
I'll crawl around your resting-place.

And when the livid morning falls,
You'll find alone the empty walls,
And till the evening, cold it'll be.

As others with their tenderness,
Upon your life and youthfulness,
I'll reign alone with dread over you.
