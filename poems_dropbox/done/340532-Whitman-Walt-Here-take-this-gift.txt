Here, take this gift,
I was reserving it for some hero, speaker, or general,
One who should serve the good old cause, the great idea, the progress and freedom of the race, 
Some brave confronter of despots, some daring rebel; 
But I see that what I was reserving belongs to you just as much as to any.
