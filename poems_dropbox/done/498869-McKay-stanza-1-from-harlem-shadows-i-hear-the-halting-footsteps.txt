Stanza 1 from HARLEM SHADOWS 

I hear the halting footsteps of a lass	
  In Negro Harlem when the night lets fall	
Its veil. I see the shapes of girls who pass	
  Eager to heed desire’s insistent call:	
Ah, little dark girls, who in slippered feet	        
  Go prowling through the night from street to street.
