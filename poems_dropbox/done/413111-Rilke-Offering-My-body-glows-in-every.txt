My body glows in every vein and blooms
To fullest flower since I first knew thee,
My walk unconscious pride and power assumes;
Who art you then— you who awaits me?

When from the past I draw myself the while
I lose old traits as leaves of autumn fall;
I only know the radiance of your smile,
Like the soft gleam of stars, transforming all.

Through childhood's years I wandered unaware
Of shimmering visions my thoughts now arrests
To offer you, as on an altar fair
That's lighted by the bright flame of thy hair
And wreathed by the blossoms of your breasts.
