To see her shape
Invert the ape!

The Apes, from whom we are descended,
Hang ape-x down from trees suspended,
And since we find them in the trees,
We term them arbor-iginees.
We all have seen the monkey-shines,
Cut up by those who pluck from vines
The Grape and then subject its juices
To Baccha-nalian abuses.
