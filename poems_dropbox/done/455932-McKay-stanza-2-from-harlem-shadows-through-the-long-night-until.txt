Stanza 2 from HARLEM SHADOWS 

Through the long night until the silver break	
  Of day the little gray feet know no rest,	
Through the lone night until the last snow-flake	
  Has dropped from heaven upon the earth’s white breast,	        
The dusky, half-clad girls of tired feet	
  Are trudging, thinly shod, from street to street.
