Pile of embers in the darkness,
  Sparks expire as they fly—
Night conceals us from the passing,
  On the bridge we'll say good-by!
At the parting, shawl of crimson
  Cross my shoulders thou shalt lace,
At an end the days swift passing,
  Met within this shaded place.
In the morning, with first splendor,
  All my life compelled to rove—
I shall leave with other gipsies
  Seeking happiness and love.
How does fate foretell my future?
  Who, to-morrow by my side,
Over my heart will loose with kisses
  Knots by thy dear hand fast tied?
Flash of embers in the darkness,
  Sparks expire as they fly—
Night conceals us from the passing,
  On the bridge we'll kiss good-by!
