The antique Persians taught three useful things,
   To draw the bow, to ride, and speak the truth.
This was the mode of Cyrus, best of kings—
   A mode adopted since by modern youth.
Bows have they, generally with two strings;
   Horses they ride without remorse or ruth;
At speaking truth perhaps they are less clever,
But draw the long bow better now than ever.
