ANSWER

I am myself—you cannot take my dreams
And pull the filmy stuff of them apart!
I am myself—and life IS what it seems.
I am myself, and love is in my heart!
You cannot make me think by fast set rule,
You cannot laugh beliefs like mine away,
Experience MAY be a bitter school,
And yet.... The golden sun shines every day,
And stars at night lend magic to the sky,
And all the world is vividly a-glow,
You cannot make me pause to question why
For we who dare to dream have learned to know!

THE WORLD IS RIGHT! There is a friendly One
Who smiles when we have tried to do our part—
I will not flinch, my journey's just begun....
I AM MYSELF—YOU CANNOT BREAK MY HEART!
