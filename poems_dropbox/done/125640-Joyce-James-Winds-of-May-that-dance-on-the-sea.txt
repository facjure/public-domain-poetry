     Winds of May, that dance on the sea,
     Dancing a ring-around in glee
     From furrow to furrow, while overhead
     The foam flies up to be garlanded,
     In silvery arches spanning the air,
     Saw you my true love anywhere?
     Welladay! Welladay!
     For the winds of May!
     Love is unhappy when love is away!
