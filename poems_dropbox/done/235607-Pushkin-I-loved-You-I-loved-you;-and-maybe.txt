I loved you; and maybe until this moment
Within my breast is smoldering still the fire!
But I would spare your pain the least renewal,
Nothing will again wake up the old desire!
I loved you with a silent desperation—
Now timid, now with jealousy brought low,
I loved devoutly,—with such deep devotion—
May God grant another love you so!
