I AM the wind that wavers,	
  You are the certain land;	
I am the shadow that passes	
  Over the sand.	
 
I am the leaf that quivers,	        5
  You the unshaken tree;	
You are the stars that are steadfast,	
  I am the sea.	
 
You are the light eternal—	
  Like a torch I shall die;	        10
You are the surge of deep music,	
  I but a cry!
