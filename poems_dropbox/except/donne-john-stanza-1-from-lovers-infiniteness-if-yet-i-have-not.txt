IF yet I have not all thy love,	
    Dear, I shall never have it all;	
I cannot breathe one other sigh to move,	
Nor can entreat one other tear to fall;	
And all my treasure, which should purchase thee,	        
Sighs, tears, and oaths, and letters, I have spent;	
  Yet no more can be due to me,	
  Than at the bargain made was meant:	
If, then, thy gift of love was partial,	
That some to me, some should to others fall,	        
  Dear, I shall never have it all.
