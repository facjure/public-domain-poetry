There is the silence of a great hatred,	
And the silence of a great love,	
And the silence of an embittered friendship.	
There is the silence of a spiritual crisis,	
Through which your soul, exquisitely tortured,	        35
Comes with visions not to be uttered	
Into a realm of higher life.	
There is the silence of defeat.	
There is the silence of those unjustly punished;	
And the silence of the dying whose hand	        40
Suddenly grips yours.	
There is the silence between father and son,	
When the father cannot explain his life,	
Even though he be misunderstood for it.
