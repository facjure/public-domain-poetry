The Hidden Banner is planted in the temple of the sky; there the blue canopy decked with the moon and set with bright jewels is spread.
There the light of the sun and the moon is shining: still your mind to silence before that splendor.
Kabir says: "He who has drunk of this nectar, wanders like one who is mad."
