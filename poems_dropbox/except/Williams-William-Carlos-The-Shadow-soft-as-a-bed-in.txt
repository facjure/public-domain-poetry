SOFT as the bed in the earth	
Where a stone has lain—	
So soft, so smooth and so cool,	
Spring closes me in	
With her arms and her hands.	        
 
Rich as the smell	
Of new earth on a stone,	
That has lain, breathing	
The damp through its pores—	
Spring closes me in	        
With her blossomy hair;	
Brings dark to my eyes.
