THE SHADOWS of the ships	
Rock on the crest	
In the low blue lustre	
Of the tardy and the soft inrolling tide.	
 
A long brown bar at the dip of the sky	        
Puts an arm of sand in the span of salt.	
 
The lucid and endless wrinkles	
Draw in, lapse and withdraw.	
Wavelets crumble and white spent bubbles	
Wash on the floor of the beach.	        
 
      Rocking on the crest	
      In the low blue lustre	
      Are the shadows of the ships.
