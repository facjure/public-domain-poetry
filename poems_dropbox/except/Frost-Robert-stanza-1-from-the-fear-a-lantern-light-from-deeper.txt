A LANTERN light from deeper in the barn	
Shone on a man and woman in the door	
And threw their lurching shadows on a house	
Near by, all dark in every glossy window.	
A horse’s hoof pawed once the hollow floor,	        5
And the back of the gig they stood beside	
Moved in a little. The man grasped a wheel,	
The woman spoke out sharply, “Whoa, stand still!”	
“I saw it just as plain as a white plate,”	
She said, “as the light on the dashboard ran	        10
Along the bushes at the roadside—a man’s face.	
You must have seen it too.”
