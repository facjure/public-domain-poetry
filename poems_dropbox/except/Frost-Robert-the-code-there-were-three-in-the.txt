THERE were three in the meadow by the brook	
Gathering up windrows, piling cocks of hay,	
With an eye always lifted toward the west	
Where an irregular sun-bordered cloud	
Darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger	        5
Flickering across its bosom. Suddenly	
One helper, thrusting pitchfork in the ground,	
Marched himself off the field and home. One stayed.	
The town-bred farmer failed to understand.
