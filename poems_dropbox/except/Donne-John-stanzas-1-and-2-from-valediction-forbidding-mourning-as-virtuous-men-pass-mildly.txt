AS virtuous men pass mildly away,	
  And whisper to their souls to go;	
While some of their sad friends do say,	
  Now his breath goes, and some say, No;	
 
So let us melt, and make no noise,	        5
  No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;	
’Twere profanation of our joys	
  To tell the laity our love.
