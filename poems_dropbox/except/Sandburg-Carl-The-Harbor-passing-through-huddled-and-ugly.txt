PASSING through huddled and ugly walls,	
By doorways where women haggard	
Looked from their hunger-deep eyes,	
Haunted with shadows of hunger-hands,	
Out from the huddled and ugly walls,	        
I came sudden, at the city’s edge,	
On a blue burst of lake,	
Long lake waves breaking under the sun	
On a spray-flung curve of shore;	
And a fluttering storm of gulls,	        
Masses of great gray wings	
And flying white bellies	
Veering and wheeling free in the open.
