THERE was never a sound beside the wood but one,	
And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground.	
What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself;	
Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,	
Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound—	        5
And that was why it whispered and did not speak.	
It was no dream of the gift of idle hours,	
Or easy cold at the hand of fay or elf:	
Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak	
To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows—	        10
Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers	
(Pale orchises)—and scared a bright green snake.	
The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows.	
My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make.
