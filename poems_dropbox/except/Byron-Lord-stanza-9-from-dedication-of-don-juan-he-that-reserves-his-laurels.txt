He that reserves his laurels for posterity
      (Who does not often claim the bright reversion)
    Has generally no great crop to spare it, he
      Being only injured by his own assertion;
    And although here and there some glorious rarity
      Arise like Titan from the sea's immersion,
    The major part of such appellants go
    To--God knows where--for no one else can know.
