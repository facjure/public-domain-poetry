Tell me, Swan, your ancient tale.
From what land do you come, Swan? to what shore will you fly?
Where would you take your rest, Swan, and what do you seek?
Even this morning, Swan, awake, arise, follow me! There is a land where no doubt nor sorrow have rule: where the terror of Death is no more. There the woods of spring are a-bloom, and the fragrant scent "He is I" is borne on the wind: There the bee of the heart is deeply immersed, and desires no other joy.
