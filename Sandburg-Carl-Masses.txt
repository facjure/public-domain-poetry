AMONG the mountains I wandered and saw blue haze and red crag and was amazed;	
On the beach where the long push under the endless tide maneuvers, I stood silent;	
Under the stars on the prairie watching the Dipper slant over the horizon’s grass, I was full of thoughts.	
Great men, pageants of war and labor, soldiers and workers, mothers lifting their children—these all I touched, and felt the solemn thrill of them.	
And then one day I got a true look at the Poor, millions of the Poor, patient and toiling; more patient than crags, tides, and stars; innumerable, patient as the darkness of night—and all broken, humble ruins of nations.	        5
